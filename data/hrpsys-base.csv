See https://svn.boost.org/trac10/ticket/7364
There's no sign of the patch posted on that page being merged upstream.

We work around this by (a) using C++98 constructs and (b) using
convert_to_container to explicitly convert to vectors and maps.

If we can afford to drop C++98 support (which is probably doable, given
that gcc 4 already supports quite a bit of C++11 with appropriate
flags), initializer lists will be much more concise and trouble-free.
