several enum parameters have the same numerical values. That case cannot be

Unfortunately, per-component debian package generation and automatic dependency

per-component debian package dependency declaration has been added in CMake

depends on the 'runtime' package.

overriding a method. clang-tidy can help automatically add it to relevant
methods. It also does a lot of cleanup by removing `virtual` when both
`virtual` and `override` are specified. Same with `override` and `final`: final
methods are implicitly overrides and thus makes the `override` specifier
redundant.

For reference, this was done with clang-tidy-3.8:

    ls parameter/*cpp | xargs -n1 clang-tidy-3.8 \
        -checks=modernize-use-override -fix -p=<path-to-build-dir> \
        -header-filter=parameter

and CMake was ran with the `-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1` option. Note the
use of xargs: when running clang-tidy on multiple files at once, strange things
happen and the files are left in state that wouldn't compile. clang-format also
needs to be run after clang-tidy.

don't make libxml2 automatically validate our files (we only do it manually),
we don't need this attribute.

Moreover, this attribute is hard to use:
- when it is set to a relative path, the file containing it cannot be moved;
- when set to an absolute path, it can't be copied between machines without
  modifying that attribute.

We used to set it to a base name (""FooBard.xsd"") which was the name of the root
element contatenated with "".xsd"" but this is redundant. In tests, it also led
to generating documents with this attribute and a root element that does not
have a corresponding standalone XSD (e.g. ParameterBlock does not have its own
XSD). For instance:

    <ParameterBlock xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=""ParameterBlock.xsd"">

When trying to validate a file, just rely on the base dir provided by the user
and the root element name in order to find the corresponding XSD file.

socket (provided that they asked for this interface to be started). Some
features are only available through this interface.

In upcoming patches, we want to use those features and send such commands but
we don't want to use a remote interface, which is sometimes painful. This patch
makes the ""remote"" commands available through a programmatic API. This API
expects a command name and a string-vector containing the arguments; which
makes it fairly easy to use and to implement a user interface providing the
same commands as they are used to - but without the need of a socket.

The object that provides this API is allocated by the Parameter Framework but
is owned by the client - we want to be C++03-retrocompatible, which forbids us
from returning a unique_ptr, this is why we return a raw pointer.

This patch introduces a functional test
that uses the instrospection subsystem
to check the auto-sync feature.

Two sequences are tested:
- when auto-sync is activated, parameter sync
  occurs when a parameter is changed
  in the blackboard.
- when auto-sync is off, parameter sync
  occurs when tha auto-sync is turned to on.

a CXmlSerializingContext. Nevertheless in a lot of called method
it was wrongfully down casted to other subclass.

Until recently it did not trigger UB as exportElementToXMLString
was luckily not called on element that did the downcast.

Recently, ConfigurableElement was change to also do this down cast,
triggering a bug on export and import structure.

Change exportElementToXMLString so that it is the caller that creates
the context based on the element type.

the library name but the Parameter Framework was trying to deduce it based on
how library files are usually named on Linux, i.e. prefixed with ""lib"", then the
soname, then "".so"".

This is not always true on Linux and this is usually false on Windows.

Also, if the API of this symbol changes, there is no way to know at
compile-time.

Which is why this rework introduces a macro to be used by plugins. This macro
is the name of the entry-point symbol to be declared by plugins and will be
retrieved by the Parameter Framework.

A new header is added and exported to plugins: Plugin.h. This header declares
the entry-point and also declares it to be visible (a private entry-point
would be useless). Plugins should use this header in the file defining their
entry-point.

For now, we only support one API version at a time: if the API changes from V1
to V2, the plugins won't compile and the Parameter Framework won't recognize
previously-compiled plugins using V1. If we want backward-compatibility, we can
add it later by declaring both macros (V1 and V2) and trying to find the symbol
corresponding to V1 if the symbol corresponding to V2 can't be found.

The first name of the macro is: PARAMETER_FRAMEWORK_PLUGIN_ENTRYPOINT_V1

Implementation detail: the implementation is split between Plugin.h,
SubsystemLibrary and SystemClass: everything the plugin needs to know is put
under Plugin.h, what must be shared between the plugin and the core is under
Subsystemlibrary and the parts private to the core are under SystemClass - which
is the class responsible for loading the plugins.

is the same as the parameter size.

But get parameter returns all the array, as a result
there is not array size to check.

The problem was that a single function was used for

Thus when wanting to check get access on an array,
no size could be given and -1 was used instead.

As a result -1 was implicitly cast to uint32_t.

a file size and a structure size. This leaded to precision loss on
windows.

`istream::pos_type` represent the position in a file stream.
Thus when at the end of the file, it represent it's size.
As a result `pos_type` must be able to represent any file size.

`size_t` on the other hand must be able to represent any contiguous
memory array size.

Those two type are not necessary the same but it is safe to assume
that `pos_type` is equal or bigger than `size_t`, as supported
system can all have files a lot bigger than the usual memory size.

As a result when comparing a file size and a structure size, use
`pos_type`.

There are several wais to avoid that,
and thus express that this parameter is rightfully unused.

 1) remove the unused parameter warning
    => but their are errors when that would be hided
 2) declare de parameter as __attribute__((unused))
    => but it is gcc/clang specific
 3) use the parameter in a no-op operation
    (usually by casting it to void)
    => but using the parameter declared as unused by this mean
       will not trigger an error
 4) remove the parameter identifier (leaving the type) from the function
    => but when the name is non redundant with the type,
       this looses information and thus make review harder.
 5) comment the parameter identifier
    => no drawback

As a result it has been chosen to normalize all unused parameters
with the 5th solution.
Some unused parameter have been renamed if they were too long.

Inital values of virtual susbsystem parameters in the blackboard may be
incorrect with respect to their type defintion. This may lead to situations
where it's impossible to import settings which were previously exported.

The reason:
Backward synchronization process occuring at start time ensures a proper
initialization of the blackboard by collecting all the syncers and
triggering a back synchronization on them. Only, the syncer set collection
was not properly implemented in Virtual Subsystem, meaning that its syncer
was not collected.

This patch ensures that the virtual subsystem syncer (called virtual
syncer) gets properly collected when filling the syncer set at
ConfigurableElement ancestor class level, by implementing the
fillSyncerSetFromDescendant() virtual method at its level.

part of the parameter tree. CElementHandle objects can be created by calling
the platform connector class new createElementHandle() functionality.
Element handle objects are owned by the application so it's its
responsibility to destroy them through a ""delete"" operation.

The following functionalities are available in CElementHandle class:
    - getting element's name
    - getting element's path in parameter hierarchy tree
    - getting element's memory size in bytes
    - determining if element is rogue
    - getting the structure of the element (expanded version of the
      structure)
    - getting/setting the element's settings in XML format
    - getting/setting the element's settings in binary format

Notes:
    - setting the element's settings in binary shall be done cautiously:
      no check is made as to the data integrity, meaning the operation
      could result in inconsistent parameter states where some
      parameter values are out of range or invalid wrt their type
    - setting the element's settings will fail if the element is not rogue
      (belong to a domain or one of its descendent does)
    - if a tuning application has set the auto sync mode to off, the
      changes applied through CElementHandle will be forward-synchronized
      when the auto sync mode is set back to on or when the ""sync"" remote
      command is executed.
    - when the tuning mode is on, calls to setAsXML() and setAsBytes() will
      fail silently (do nothing but return true meaning success)

For automation purpose, this patch adds an option allowing the user
to specify several scenarios on command line.

Also, the default behaviour used to be: ""after a scenario has been executed,
present the user with a menu in order to run more of them"". The new behaviour
is to exit the Client Simulator after the scenarios have been run; the old
behaviour can be reproduced with the new ""--no-exit"" option.

If neither --scenario nor --interactive nor --no-exit are passed, then the same
behaviour as with --no-exit is applied.

exports to a stream.

Since the public APIs take:

- a string as argument that can either contain an actual XML document or a

- a boolean stating which of the above cases it is,

we need wrappers to convert that semantic into the new ""everything is a stream""
semantic. A lot of code can then be factorized.

The pull request #88 was reverted as it broke travis build.

ctest uses a cache variable MEMCHECK_SUPPRESSION_FILE.
It sets it during the include(ctest) evaluation.

Cache variable are set on creation, they can not be modify after by a
CMakeList.mk (except with set's FORCE option).

ef5736e sets MEMCHECK_SUPPRESSION_FILE as a normal variable.
This does not set the cache variable as expected but rather create
a second local variable (not part of the cache) with the same name.

If cmake was run once (as during travis build since patch 4e41ff7,
until its revert d17b931), the local variable has no effect
thus the suppression file was never saved in the cache.

If cmake was run twice, during the second time, as the cache version
is not recreated (cache variables are persistent),
the call to set MEMCHECK_SUPPRESSION_FILE changes the cache version as
it was first expected.

As a result the build worked if cmake was invoked twice but failed
if only called once.

For more information, see the *** Variable types in CMake *** section at:

wrongfully accepted by the parameter-framework) starting from high precisions,
e.g. q0.16.

The cause is:

1) When converting strings to fixed-points, the parameter-framework first
parses the input string as double. Doubles have 52 fraction bits and there for
15 decimal-digits-precision (52 * log10(2) == 15).

2) When displaying Qn.m numbers, we decided to display all representable digits
(i.e. m digits) instead of only displaying significant digits because that
would cause unpredictable behaviour. See
d299108157ee4d0eadb7683b2fa6a6635bc63d95 and
59cc1e33810c55e6fa1e3bd320e1cf29e24d23be for more information.

3) However, the precision for a Qn.m fixed-point number isn't m but
m * log10(2). This is guaranteed to be less than the precision of a double but
the tests mentioned at the beginning were written as if the precision was m,
which may be larger than the precision of a double. This is what caused the
test failures.

The tests are adapted to try and set a value of which the last significant
digit is one-off too far outside of the allowed range.

For lower-precision number, other less-far-off values could be correctly
rejected by the parameter-framework but that's only because of the underlying
implementation (using doubles as intermediate values) and it seems hardly
relevant to check.

the children and set their ""Name"" attribute.

With this approach, the toplevel element's name isn't set unless its overrided
implementation explicitly does so.

A first approach for fixing that is to set the XmlElement's name and
recursively call toXml on children (without setting their name because it will
be done by their toXml method). However, the ""CXmlElement"" being created may or
may not be the object on which the toXml method is called, in which case the
name will be set on the wrong XmlElement.

Instead, in CElement::toXml, we set the XmlElement's name and call a new
virtual method, childrenToXml which only recursively call toXml on children.

This gives full flexibility to elements to choose how they want to serialize
themselves and how they want to serialize their children.

CConfigurableDomain::toXml is modified to take that change into account.

broken on Android because libremote-processor is compiled as

load ""libremote-processor.so"" anyway.

For now, let's ignore the Android build system and only care about how we do it
with CMake: CMake builds libremote-processor.so, test-platform and
remote-process so let's remove the ""_host"" suffixes that were added for
compatibility with the output of the Android makefiles.

Previous version of PfwCriteriaTest project was asking for an
init file to be launched. It was not needed when init file was
corresponding to default values.

This patch allows PfwCriteriaTest to set default values when
no init file is given. The script just set the noValue to
all criteria.

The init file is now only useful to set a desired init
state to test the switch between two use cases.

Previously, tests actions (such as media_playback) were
hardcoded in the PfwCriteriaTest project. The problem
was that the PFW can be used for much more than audio.
So, the PFWCriteriaTest project was only useful to test
audio use cases.

This patch aims to dissociate test cases generation
from test behaviour (such as media_playback).
To regroup all audio tests, a new configuration file
has been created : audio-test-type.json.

This file allows user to add new test behaviours.
So, each test vector is associated to a set of commands.
The associated script is launched when the execute
function of TestLauncher.py is called.
The audio-test-type.json files contains the type name,
its script, and a boolean to specify if we must wait the
entire script execution prior to continue.
This boolean is important when we want to launch long
commands, such as alsa commands that we want to run
during the entire test process.

The setCriterionState command of the Test Platform was
setting undesired value when asking for multiple states
to an InclusiveCriterion.
The method used in setCriterionStateByLexicalSpace was
to parse arguments before to get numerical value for
each of them with the getNumericalValue method from
ISelectionCriterionTypeInterface. Then, different
masks were aggregated to set the criterion's state.
Regarding the getNumericalValue method behaviour which
parses automatically value arguments, this method leads
to undesired bytes in the mask which leads to undesired
criterion's state.

The solution is to aggregate the setCriterionState
arguments when more than one arg are used.
As getNumericalValue use | to split his first parameter,
the code has been modified to use this behaviour.
getNumericalValue is now called only one
time and the returned mask is directly used to set
criterion's state.

This was not done in the parameter-framework's makefiles.

This patch change all targets which require stlport to include it in the
correct way.

There is an issue when trying to set parameter value in a

The error returned is ""Unable to forward synchronize

The root cause is a recent update concerning the
auto synchronization mode which is now turned on by default.
The setConfigurationParameter command first updates the local
Configuration blackboard, and then the Main blackboard if this
Configuration is the one applicable for the domain. However,
this local blackboard should not be synchronized, only the
main blackboard should be. This patch deactivates synchronization
for the local blackboard.

When hostDomainGenerator.sh is called by the build system, it needs to
copy schema files to /tmp/tmp.XXXXXXX. This is because
parameter-framework needs to have the schema files next to the .xml
files in order to apply validation.

In order to do that, hostDomainGenerator.sh needs to know where he can
copy the .xsd files from.

Currently, the .xsd files are copied from
$HOST_OUT/etc/parameter-framework/Schemas via a dedicated makefile.
This used a phony package to group all the files that have to be copied.

The problem is that phony packages the phony package is not calling the
prebuildt rules we need. So the files we want to export to
/etc/parameter-framework/Schemas are not copied.

This patch removes the phony package in order to produce the expected
behaviour.

Significant digits were computed in order to prevent odd behaviour when printing

double to the user (or towards a file).
The printing showed only the significant digits, in other words, the
digits which can vary from 0 to 9. This caused unpredictable behaviour
when rounding using the setPrecision() function.

This patch removes the 'precision' notion related to fixed points in

For schema validation features, we are using a special version of libxml2 called
libxml2-schemas (which contains the SCHEMAS feature).
This is just a different static library build with that feature only for
the parameter-framework.
The problem with that, is that the include/xmlversion.h does not
define the #LIBXML_SCHEMAS_ENABLED flag.
So when including it in our project, the flag is not defined.
This results in unexpected behaviour since validation was active in the
static library, but never called because the flag was not defined.

As a fix, we are defining the LIBXML_SCHEMAS_ENABLED flag in the makefile.

Explain the precision computation (m * log10(2)):

  For a Qn.m number, the step between each storable number is 2^(-m).
  Hence, on a decimal representation, the Dth digit after the decimal
  point can take all possible values (1..9) - meaning that it is
  significant - only if

          2^(-m) <= 10^(-D)
              -m <= log2(10^(-D))
              -m <= log10(10^(-D)) / log10(2)
              -m <= -D / log10(2)
    m * log10(2) >= D

  Conversly, the Dth digit can be represented if

    D <= m * log10(2)

We add 1 to the precision in order to display the digit right after the last
significant digit.  This will lead to oddities such as:

    $ setParameter /Test/test/f32_Q8.23 0.1234569
    $ getParameter /Test/test/f32_Q8.23
    > 0.1234570

but it will avoid modifying raw values when converting from string to Q-format
and back to string.

Also, use std::setprecision() on the stream instead of manually truncating the
displayed number.

When the initial XML file for tuning is too big, the XML generation
fails with the message: ""Argument list too long"". This is because the
generation relies on the PFW command ""setDomainsWithSettingsXML"", which
takes XML data as string argument. There is a limitation concerning
the size of this string, leading to the current issue.

This patch replaces the call to ""setDomainsWithSettingsXML"" by
""importDomainsWithSettingsXML"", which takes a file as argument instead
of a string. There is no limitation on the file size.

Add a class (ConfigurableMappingElement) handling the mapping; to be derived by
all classes that can contain mapping.  ConfigurableMappingElement derives from
ConfigurableElement.  Until now, the only child of ConfigurableElement that
could have mapping was InstanceConfigurableElement (through TypeElement, that
contains all information related to its type).

Now, both InstanceConfigurableElement and Subsystem derive from
ConfigurableMappingElement.  That way, Subsystem XML elements can now have a
""Mapping"" attribute, propagated to all Elements in the tree.  The Subsystem.xsd
schema is updated in that regard.

Only context mapping is relevant at the Subsystem-level (as opposed to
instantiation mapping).  If an instantiation mapping is set in the Subsystem,
it is silently ignored.

If localhost is not bound to 127.0.0.1, socket creation fails in the

This patch updates portAllocator.py so that the IP address 127.0.0.1
is used instead of localhost. In addition, the potential error messages
raised by portAllocator.py are now correctly taken into account by
hostDomainGenerator.sh. HostDomainGenerator.sh has also been updated
to replace all instances of 'localhost' by '127.0.0.1'.

When multiple process run hostDomainGenerator.sh, some race conditions
occur, despite current locking mechanism.

In consequence, the script has been modified in order to make sure that
available socket ports can be chosen for test-platform and PFW processes:
- portAllocator.py: python script which creates a new socket using a random
available port, and displays the port chosen. This port number is then
pushed to the end of the available ports list by the system.
- hostDomainGenerator.sh: uses portAllocator.py to get free ports for
test-platform and the PFW.

Fixed multiple issues as well:
- When an error occur, a cleanup function was called and sometimes would
kill concurrent processes. Now, only the test-platform and PFW instances
started by the current hostDomainGenerator.sh script will be stopped,
- Test-platform startup was not checked correctly,
- The creation of the symlink to libremote-processor.so sometimes failed,
leading to an early cleanup.

The ""man 7 tcp"" page speaks for itself:
TCP_NODELAY
  If  set, disable the Nagle algorithm.  This means that segments are always
sent as soon as possible, even if there is only a small amount of data.  When
not set, data is buffered until there is a  sufficient amount to send out,
thereby avoiding the frequent sending of small packets, which results in poor
utilization of the network.

The behaviour described above if this option is not set introduces a lot of
overhead when several commands are sent with remote-processor because they
are not sent in burst mode: instead, remote-processor wait for the answer to
each command.

See ""man 7 tcp"" for all the details.

When using getConfigurationParameter on a BooleanParameter, the displayed value is
duplicated on the output if the configuration is applicable.

The method CParameterMgr::accessConfigurationValue() accesses the element twice
when the configuration is the last one applied (in order to update the parameter value
in both the configuration blackboard and the main blackboard).
The output result is managed using a string passed as reference
to ParameterMgr::accessValue() and then to CBooleanParameterType::fromBlackboard().
In the latest method, the boolean value is appended to the output string, however no
check is performed to make sure that the string is empty before being used.
As the method is called twice with the same output string, we end up with a dupplicated
output.
This fix updates CBooleanParameterType::fromBlackboard() in order to make sure that
the output string is overwritten with the current result.

This patch adds scripts to generate and test PFW domain XML.

tools/xmlGenerator provides script to generate PFW domains from XML:
    - updateRoutageDomains.sh update the domains of the connected board
        with the provided .pfw file.
    - lightRoutingUpdate.sh is a light version of updateRoutageDomains.sh
        it does not need test-platform but needs a board with a properly
        configure PFW (typicaly the hal pfw).
    - analyse provide script to convert asound.conf to domains

test/test-scripts provides scripts to instanciate a test platform
(virtal hal) and simulate the route manager routing steps:
    - */*_envsetup.sh is a list of environement configation file. Source the file
        corresponding to your situation.
    - test-routing.sh allow the user to simulate different routing use
        cases.

This was due to the results of strtol/strtoll which was not correctly checked (it would only fail

So for fixed point values, only the first part of the string was fetched, giving the impression of a truncation at the '.' character .

When exporting the settings to an XML file and importing this file right after,
an error occurs on some fixed point parameters.  The values of these
parameters are incorrectly saved into the output file.

This bug is due to a precision error when converting the raw value from the
blackboard. The setprecision() manipulator rounds the result instead of
truncating it, sometimes leading to an overflow.  The fix consists in
performing a truncation after the last significant digit.

When reading from the blackboard a value of type fixed point

- Added a call to signExtend() before the conversion,
- Updated the display as well (precision support),
- Set up the notation type (fixed) to prevent the scientific notation display.

Compilation on target would fail because of the use of an ambigous
function : log10. Changed the notation of the number to double for the
parameter of this function to force binding to: double log10(double).

strtol/strtoul functions return the value -1 which was then assumed correct
by the PFW. Now the errno value is checked to ensure that no range error

If a subsystem library depends on another one, the libraries have to be loaded
in a predefined order.

the previous recovery mechanism on PFW was: When a subsystem library does not
load because of a missing dependency, it tries to load all the other subsystems
before trying one more time to load the failing library.

Unfortunately, Android linker does not allow several try when loading a
library.

In consequence, this patch implements a new mechanism to load its subsystem
libraries.
For this new mechanism, the PFW will load the subsystem libraries in the order

These changes enable handling changing the rules for configuration application
from the command line interface.
It is possible to assign a new rule, to display the existing one or to clear
it.
Restriction: like in XML, root rule must be compound.
Syntax is the following:
- Criterion rule expression:
<criterion> <verb> <object>
- Compound rule expression
(All|Any){<content>}
where <content> is a comma separated list of any kind of rules.
Example:
All{Any{SelectedOutputDevice Includes Headphones, SelectedOutputDevice
 Includes Headset}, Any{Mode Is Normal, Mode Is RingTone}}
means the pertaining configuration will be applied when Selected device
includes either Headphones or Headset, while, ate the same time, Mode is
either Normal or RingTone.

Added dumpDomains remote command to show a summary of domains, configurations
as well as their application conditions (tree view).

Removed not anymore necessary guard against deletion of domains or
configurations that contain rules, ad now they're controlled from the CLI.

Replaced high level string based parameter access interface with typed ones.
Now hosting platforms that want to control parameters must instantiate a
CParameterHandle object out of the desired parameter path.
CParameterHandle object may be used to access any kind of parameters, whatever
its internal type, whether it's an array or not.
Note that non rogue parameters offer a read access only. Any attempt to write
them will fail.
CParameterHandle objects offer the following kind of parameter accessing
interfaces:
- Boolean
- Integer (signed or unsigned)
- Double
- String
Note that those interfaces are available for scalar as well as for array
parameters.
Not all parameter types support all access kinds. Naturally, array parameters
are only accessed via array interfaces while scalar parameters are managed
through scalar interfaces.
Here's a list of parameter types that may be controlled through each kind of
access interface:
- Boolean access: boolean, bit (bit size must be one);
- Integer access: integer (sign must match), boolean (unsigned access only,
value <= 1), enumerations;
- Double access: for now only fixed points (soon integers will support them
also through platform adaptation objects)
- String access: all parameter types

In addition, cleaned up parameter access related code so as to make it more
generic and reusable.

Changed version to 2.0.0

- Introduced sequence notion in configurations:
Sequences are configuration specific and are controlled from the Settings
related XML files (order of settings appearance) as well as from the tuning
interface (new commands available to set and get the sequence
(setElementSequence / getElementSequence).
Notes:
	- sequences will only matter for domains which new ""SequenceAware""
attribute is set to true (false by default). This attribute is also
controlable through the tuning interface (setSequenceAware / getSequenceAware
commands).
	- sequence unaware domain configurations will be applied before
sequence aware ones.

To allow for such functionality, the XML for settings format had to be
reworked, leading to an unfortunate compatibility break. However, one benefit
is that now a clear Settings section appears at the bottom of the domain
description, which is easier to maintain than the previous structure where the
settings appeared as sub-nodes of associated elements.

Parameter-framework is still-under-development, Intel proprietary,
multi-platform (standard C++, for now only linux, no dependency on
Android) software that allows system-wide parameter management. It
relies on a number of configurations files, from which it knows how
/ when to hand out settings towards the hardware (subsystems) at
runtime.
3 kinds of configuration files are used:
- Structure description files indicating the actual parameter
structure, types, min/max values, data representation.
- Configurable domain description file containing the actual
distribution of parameters over different domains, that is, different
set of configurations, each of which being dynamically activated
based on selection criteria rules that are themselves configurable.
Configurable domains file contain the tuned settings along the tuning
process, that is during the period where the system is being tuned.
- Binary settings file used to store the settings when the tuning
process is complete.

Changing any of those files causes no recompilation of the framework.
This project is based on a open plugin architecture allowing any kind
of subsystems to be handled, whatever their respective Endianness.
It fully relies on the platform SW to provide it with with the
kowledge of exisitng selection criteria (selected device, current
mode), as well as change events that occuring on them, thus
triggering the application of corresponding configuration settings
wherever appropriate.
It supports handling mutliple parameter classes (Audio, Energy
management) through TCP/IP interface.
For now tuning commands can be sent to parameter-framework instances
through a command-line utility, via adb over USB or via ethernet/WIFI.
