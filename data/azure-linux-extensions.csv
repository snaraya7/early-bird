* Update postMasterOracle.sql

1) Remove use of SUSPEND, which is dependent on seldom-used Oracle Resource Manager
2) Handle scenario with SQL*Plus connecting ""/NOLOG"" and database instance not OPEN successfully
3) Handle scenario with database instance running in NOARCHIVELOG mode successfully

* Update preOracleMaster.sql

1) remove use of SUSPEND, which is dependent on seldom-used Oracle Resource Manager
2) handle scenario where SQL*Plus is started with ""/NOLOG"" option and Oracle database instance is not OPEN
3) handle scenario where Oracle database instance is running NOARCHIVELOG mode
Goal:  perform ARCHIVE LOG CURRENT (in ARCHIVELOG mode) or LOGFILE SWITCH (in NOARCHIVELOG mode) in order to force a full database checkpoint, then put entire database into BACKUP mode

* Update WorkloadPatch.py

1) continue to call Oracle SQL*Plus with ""-S"" flag to suppress banners, prompts, etc
2) Call Oracle SQL*Plus with ""-R 2"" flag to restrict use of SQL*Plus access to underlying operating system.  For example, permit use of the START (or ""@"") command to run SQL scripts, but remove use of HOST or SPOOL commands
3) Change call to Oracle SQL*Plus from forcing connection to database when called, to instead starting program without forcing connection to database, using ""/NOLOG"" switch instead of database credentials.
NOTE:  the ""preOracleMaster.sql"" and ""postOracleMaster.sql"" scripts called by SQL*Plus will connect to the database as the limited SYSBACKUP role using external OS authentication instead of connecting to the database the all-powerful SYSDBA role using external authentication

1) Remove use of SUSPEND, which is dependent on seldom-used Oracle Resource Manager
2) Handle scenario with SQL*Plus connecting ""/NOLOG"" and database instance not OPEN successfully
3) Handle scenario with database instance running in NOARCHIVELOG mode successfully

* Update preOracleMaster.sql

1) remove use of SUSPEND, which is dependent on seldom-used Oracle Resource Manager
2) handle scenario where SQL*Plus is started with ""/NOLOG"" option and Oracle database instance is not OPEN
3) handle scenario where Oracle database instance is running NOARCHIVELOG mode
Goal:  perform ARCHIVE LOG CURRENT (in ARCHIVELOG mode) or LOGFILE SWITCH (in NOARCHIVELOG mode) in order to force a full database checkpoint, then put entire database into BACKUP mode

* Update WorkloadPatch.py

1) continue to call Oracle SQL*Plus with ""-S"" flag to suppress banners, prompts, etc
2) Call Oracle SQL*Plus with ""-R 2"" flag to restrict use of SQL*Plus access to underlying operating system.  For example, permit use of the START (or ""@"") command to run SQL scripts, but remove use of HOST or SPOOL commands
3) Change call to Oracle SQL*Plus from forcing connection to database when called, to instead starting program without forcing connection to database, using ""/NOLOG"" switch instead of database credentials.
NOTE:  the ""preOracleMaster.sql"" and ""postOracleMaster.sql"" scripts called by SQL*Plus will connect to the database as the limited SYSBACKUP role using external OS authentication instead of connecting to the database the all-powerful SYSDBA role using external authentication
