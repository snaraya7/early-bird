the highest level assembly flag (/arch:AVX / -msse4.1) would be applied
to all assembly files. This could result in higher level instructions
being used which would defeat the runtime cpu detection check and could
result in a crash.

With this change -m style flags are used with clang-cl as it supports
them and allows the correct level to be set. With at least Visual
Studio 12 (2013)+ /arch is not necessary to build SSE2 or SSE4 code
unless a lesser /arch is forced so these flags are avoided. This matches
the nmake build.

For emscripten only sse2 and sse4.1 are tested (NEON will succeed in
being enabled, but fail to build). This is consistent with

   translation of corresponding intrinsics to Wasm SIMD ones.
   See a discussion at emscripten-core/emscripten#12714 for
   automating this and making easier in the future.
 - Remove compilation branch that prevented definitions of
   `WEBP_USE_SSE` and `WEBP_USE_NEON` on Emscripten even when
   SIMD support was detected at compile-time.
 - Add an implementation of `VP8GetCPUInfo` for Emscripten which
   uses static `WEBP_USE_*` flags to determine if a corresponding
   SIMD instruction is supported. This is because Wasm doesn't
   have proper feature detection (yet) and requires making separate
   build for SIMD version anyway.

modifying the 'picture'. Changing that is not that simple because
near_lossless impacts both VP8ApplyNearLossless() and
ApplyPredictFilter(); the latter cannot be applied as is to the input
and thus the final modified 'picture' cannot be easily retrieved
without decoding the encoded bitstream. Hence ReadWebP() is called in
cwebp.c on the encoded bitstream kept in memory to get the correct
distortion.

However -get_psnr returns a different distortion than get_disto for
lossy encoding configurations because cwebp loads the source as YUV
while get_disto directly reads it as RGB without conversion loss.

compensating the under-quantization, leading to resonance
and strange patterns.

-> we special-handle the very flat blocks, hopefully for the
greater good (and not just the bad-resonance case).

For 'fast mode' (-m 3 or less), we just pay special attention
to the border of the image, where the oscillation / instability
usually starts. For the inner part of the image, since we're not
doing rd-opt, it's harder to fix anything.

Overall, on 'regular' images, the change is written the noise,
often leading to overall faster encoding (because of the short-cut).

Impact:
 - All fopen () and SHCreateStreamOnFile(),
 - All fprintf() printing file paths,
 - All strcmp() used with ""-"",
 - File path parsing,
 - Gif reading.

Concerned executables from examples/ and extras/:
  anim_diff, anim_dump, vwebp, vwebp_sdl,
  cwebp, dwebp, gif2webp, img2webp,
  webpmux, webpinfo, webp_quality, get_disto

img2webp will not work when used with an argument file and
will print ""Reading arguments from a file is a feature
unavailable with Unicode binaries.""

This aims at addressing the change in Chrome handling of loop-count
prior to M63.

Before M63: loop-count interpretation was aligned to GIF's behaviour in
Chrome, but incompatible with WebP's spec. In particular, you couldn't
loop exactly once.

Post-M63: loop-count in WebP is really the total number of loops. Gif2webp
will convert correctly from a GIF source by adjusting the loop count.

Note: The Chrome version can be retrieved from the User-Agent
string (chrome://version).
An M63 version will contain the pattern:
   Chrome/63.x.xxxx.xx
for instance.

the eos_ state.  If this happened just before a row_sync, a SaveState()
would be called that would store the eos_ state as '1' till the end
of the loop.  This usually was not a problem, except for the very last
chunk where we disable the incremental decoding altogether (we have all
the data). The termination tests were then going wrong.
The fix is to add a proper eos_ test and avoid falling in this inconsistent
state.

We were always using ExtraSamples=1, which means associated-alpha.
But we don't need the (lossy) excursion to rgbA format. We can save
the samples as RGBA directly, by changing ExtraSamples to '2'.
The TIFF encoder now checks the colorspace properly, to handle
premultiplied format as well as non-premultiplied.

Decoder:
The result of TIFFReadRGBAImageOriented() is always pre-multiply.
So, in case an alpha channel is present, we need to unmultiply it before
calling WebPPictureImportRGBA().

Reading this, you'd expect that if kmax == 0, then with any kmin <= 0
all frames will be key-frames. But actually the kmin <= 0 test is caught
first and you get the opposite (no keyframes but the first). You'd have
instead to set kmax == 0 and any value kmin > 0, which is absolutely
counter-intuitive (reversing order).
Moreover kmax == 1 has no valid kmin (kmin == 1 conflicts with the
`kmax > kmin` rule and kmin == 0 conflicts with `kmin >= kmax / 2 + 1`).
So it should be considered an exception too.

Instead I propose this new logic:
- kmax == 1 means that all frames are keyframes (you are explicitly
  requesting a keyframe every 1 frame at most, i.e. all frames).
- kmax == 0 means no keyframes (you ask for a keyframe every 0 frames,
  i.e. never).
This is more ""logical"" language-wise, and also does not involve any
conflicts about what if both kmax and kmin are 0, since now a single
property value is meaningful for the 2 exceptional cases.

 c) 'start' and 'end' can be omitted, but not the duration value.

It's only used for -m 0 and -m 1, where no full RD-opt is performed.
It actually makes these modes quite faster, with RD curve much

Here is what happened: there was a corruption bug that eventually
got fixed by 0174d18d8b51f6c9228c70066a987c30a8132995.

and cfbcc5ece022fc74ae9b987e05c2807df0d82ec5 hid the bug
by not imposing length of 1 when it was actually 2 or 3 (which does help
compression as a litteral is more efficient than an offset and a length
of size 2 or 3).

We do the following:
- Start with transparent value of 0x00000000 instead of 0x00ffffff, so that
WebPCleanupTransparentAreaLossless() is a no-op.
- Restore the original canvas after lossy encoding, to discard changes made by
WebPCleanupTransparentArea() before the next encode.

Explanation of why:
In the mixed mode, anim_encoder tries to encode using both lossless and lossy
compression. In fact, when ""min_size"" option is enabled, there are at most 4
encodes that can happen in this order:
- lossless with dispose none
- lossy with dispose none
- lossless with dispose background
- lossy with dispose background

But both lossless and lossy both potentially modify the canvas during encode
(for better compression):
- Lossless: WebPCleanupTransparentAreaLossless() turns all transparent pixels

- Lossy: WebPCleanupTransparentArea() flattens some transparent pixels

So, the result is that, sometimes we feed the modified canvas to the encoder
instead of the original one, which isn't the right thing to do.

This also applies to just lossless or just lossy encoding, as multiple encodes
happen (with the two dispose methods) in those cases too.

preprocessing step is used only when a prediction filter is not used,
otherwise a new implementation integrated into lossless_enc.c is used.

It retains the same logic for converting near lossless quality into max
number of bits dropped, and for adjusting the number of bits based on
the smoothness of the image at a given pixel. As before, borders are not
changed.

Then, instead of quantizing raw component values, the residual after
subtract green and after prediction is quantized according to the
resulting number of bits, taking care to not cross the boundary between
255 and 0 after decoding. Ties are resolved by moving closer to the
prediction instead of by bankers’ rounding.

This results in about 15% size decrease for the same quality.

Some results:
- Correctness:
Tested that anim_diff reports all images are identical for lossless, and
similar min_psnr value for lossy and mixed modes.

Also checked output images visually to make sure there weren't any
obvious kinks.

- Compression:
A very tiny improvement for 6000 image GIF set we have (0.03%) for lossy
and mixed mode. For some of these images, frames get dropped
automatically as they have a very small diff from previous frame.

10 images from test_video_frames_png show a clear improvement in
compression though. This CL leads to 7 out of 9 lossy WebPs getting
smaller -- for one of them, this leads to a higher quality being picked
(as that’s still < 150 KB).

original patch:

https://codereview.chromium.org/1657313003/

Make libwebp build with -Wconstant-conversion from newer clangs.

After http://llvm.org/viewvc/llvm-project?rev=259271&view=rev, clang
points out that _mm_set1_epi16(33050) causes an overflow in the short
argument to _mm_set1_epi16().  Since there's no version that takes an
unsigned short, add an explicit cast to tell the compiler that this is
intentional.

No behavior change.

This is useful to avoid some conversion steps between ARGB and YUVA.
For instance, if the input file is a JPEG, we decode to RGB and
convert to YUV right away, without the intermediate step to ARGB.

The only caveat is that cropping/scaling might give slightly different result,
because of YUV420 downsampling. Therefore, we omit this feature
at cwebp level, when -crop or -rescale is used.

  * split generation of image from bit-stream coding
  * move all the delta-palette code to delta_palettization.c, and only have 1 entry point there WebPSearchOptimalDeltaPalette()

We still rely on 32b x 32b -> 64b multiplies. Raised the fixed-point precision to 32b
so that we have some nice shifts from epi64 to epi32.
Changed rescaler_t type to 'uint32_t' in order to squeeze in all the precision required.

The MIPS code has been disabled because it's now out-of-sync. Will be fixed in
a subsequent CL when the dust settles.

At the beginning of method 'DecodeImageData', pixels up to
'dec->last_pixel_' are assumed to be already cached. So, at the end of
previous call to that method also, that assumption should hold true.

Hence, we should cache all pixels up to 'src' regardless of 'src_last'.

This affects lossless incremental decoding only, as that is when
src_last and src_end differ.
Note: alpha decoding is implicitly incremental, as alpha decoding of
only the rows 'y_end - y_start' happens during FinishRow() call. So, this bug
affects alpha decoding in non-incremental decoding flow as well.

This bug was introduced in: https://gerrit.chromium.org/gerrit/#/c/59716.

Also added a small penality for choosing the larger cache-size. This is done to

byte savings from smaller WebP lossless files.

Code is rewritten to maintain previous and current canvas (it used to maintain

as those from GIF may no longer apply.
Also, this renders methods like ReduceTransparency() and ConvertToKeyFrame()
redundant, as internally maintained current canvas is always independent of
previous canvases.

Disposal method choice: we pick the disposal method that results in the smallest

- Remove the recursive CostModelBuild.
- Reuse the lz77 backward refs in CostModelBuild, instead of evaluating it
  again (as it was done for recursion_level=0).
- Consolidated the Match-length logic inside FindMatchLength method.
- Removed the logic for altering best_length/val based on the 2D distance.
  The additional 162 value (+= 9 * 9 + 9 * 9 - y * y - x * x) can't change the
  best_val eval computation to choose a different curr_length, as best_val was
  set to 'curr_length << 16'.

  Following is the impact on the compression speed/density at default & max
  quality, overall this speeds up compression by 5-15% (q=100 -> 75) with a tad
  drop (0.02-0.03%) in compression density for the non-palette images.

this block is optional, and its scope is only the first graphic rendering block
that follows.

The spec doesn't mention what default values of frame dimensions, offsets,
duration and transparent index to use in such a case, though. So, we use the
defaults used by GIF reader in Chromium:

These bugs were conservative and silent, in the sense that we were 'just' doing
more work than necessary.

Now, the SSE2 version is really 2x faster than the C version.

FTransform save the output data 4 times 8 bytes each. when this data is

that caused a store to load forward block.
The fix was done in the FTransform function where each two consecutive 8 bytes

This fix gives ~21% function level gain and 1.6% user level gain.

MALLOC_MEM_LIMIT can be used similarly to prevent allocating more
than a given amount of memory. This is usually less convenient to
use than MALLOC_FAIL_AT since one has to know in advance the typical

Both these flags are meant to be used for debugging only!

For the above mentioned code-paths, allocate memory once and re-use it
subsequently.

Reduce the foorprint of VP8LHistogram struct by changing the Struct
field 'literal_' from an array of constant size to dynamically allocated
buffer based on the input parameter cache_bits.

Initialize BitWriter buffer corresponding to 16bpp (2*W*H).
There are some hard-files that are compressed at 12 bpp or more. The
realloc is costly and can be avoided for most of the WebP lossless

the original change would cause calls to e.g., WebPGetInfo to fail until

checks if the image data is available

This option allows to selectively apply some randomness to
potentially flattened-out U/V blocks and attenuate the banding.

This option is off by default in 'dwebp', but set to -dither 50

Note: depending on the number of blocks selectively dithered,
we can have up to a 10% slow-down in decoding speed it seems.

that tells the minimum filtering strength needed to trigger the
filtering of a step with amplitude 'delta'. We use this table
in various situations:

a) when computing the initial (/global) filtering
strength for each segment. We look at the quantization
step and deduce the proper filtering strength needed
to result this quantization noise (talking the -f option
into account).

b) during intra16 calculation, when a block ends up
very empty (only DC coeffs are non-zero, all ACs have
vanished). We'll rely on the in-loop filtering to
restore the smoothness (if the source was gradient-like
smooth. That's why we look at the distortion too before
triggering the filtering).

Step b) goes _in addition_ to a), potentially raising
the filtering strength if blockiness is likely.

This saturation is not absolutely needed: output of FTransformWHT
is in range [-16320, 16321]. At quality 100, max quantization steps is 8,
so the maximal range used by QuantizeBlock() is [-2040, 2040].
But there's some extra bias (mtx->bias_[] and mtx->sharpen_[]) so
it's better to leave this saturation check for now.

This change is ON by default. To return to previous behaviour, use
'cwebp -low_memory' or set config.low_memory to true.

Side-effect of this new mode: it forces 1 partition only (which was
default anyway), and makes some statistics about the bitstream
no longer available. cwebp will no longer report 'intra4-coeffs', etc.

This mode also doesn't work (yet) with multi-pass, and -low_memory
is currently forced for multi-pass.

also: reversed the flag: USE_TOKEN_BUFFER -> DISABLE_TOKEN_BUFFER
also: fixed the kAverageBytesPerMB estimate

Compression method (C): 2 bits

: The compression method used:

  * `0`: No compression.
  * `1`: Backward reference counts encoded with arithmetic encoder.

Filtering method (F): 2 bits

: The filtering method used:

  * `0`: None.
  * `1`: Horizontal filter.
  * `2`: Vertical filter.
  * `3`: Gradient filter.

Pre-processing (P): 2 bits

: These INFORMATIVE bits are used to signal the pre-processing that has
been performed during compression. The decoder can use this information to
e.g. dither the values or smooth the gradients prior to display.

  * `0`: no pre-processing
  * `1`: level reduction

Decoders are not required to use this information in any specified way.

Reserved (Rsv): 2 bits

: SHOULD be `0`.

Alpha bitstream: _Chunk Size_ - `1` bytes

: Encoded alpha bitstream.

This optional chunk contains encoded alpha data for a single tile.
Either **ALL or NONE** of the tiles must contain this chunk.

The alpha channel data is losslessly stored as raw data (when
compression method is '0') or compressed using the lossless format
(when the compression method is '1').

- Some internal methods now take 'CHUNK_INDEX' param instea of 'TAG_ID'
  as appropriate.
- Add kChunks[] entry for lossless.
- Rename WebPMuxImage.vp8_ --> WebPMuxImage.img_
- SetImage() and AddFrame/Tile() infer whether the bitstream is a
  lossless one based on LOSSLESS_MAGIC_BYTE. The correct tag is stored
  based on this.

Also, handle the case when GetVP8Info/GetVP8LInfo() fails.

90% of time table lookup is performed, while rest of time (10%) call to log

log 200 instruction counts. The weighted average comes out to be 30
instructions per call. For mid qualities (25-75), this function (VP8LFastLog)
accounts for 30-50% of total CPU cycles (via call path: VP8LCOlorSpaceTransform

called less that 1% of time, with average instructions being 15 per call.
Measured the performance over 1000 files for various qualities and found
overall compression speedup between 10-15% (in quality range [0, 75]). The
compression density loss is around 0.5% (though at some qualities, compression
is little better as well).

to have better control over the decoding process (and the speed/quality tradeoff).

WebPDecoderOptions allow to:
 - turn fancy upsampler on/off
 - turn in-loop filter on/off
 - perform on-the-fly cropping
 - perform on the-fly rescale
(and more to come. Not all features are implemented yet).

On-the-fly cropping and scaling allow to save quite some memory
(as the decoding operation will now scale with the output's size, not
the input's one). It saves some CPU too (since for instance,
in-loop filtering is partially turned off where it doesn't matter,
and some YUV->RGB conversion operations are ommitted too).

The scaler uses summed area, so is mainly meant to be used for
downscaling (like: for generating thumbnails or previews).

Incremental decoding works with these new options.
More doc to come soon.

dwebp is now using the new decoding interface, with the new flags:
  -nofancy
  -nofilter
  -crop top left width height
  -scale width height

(which is normally an undefined/invalid behaviour), we add extra data at the
end of partition #0 (so-called 'extensions')

Namely, we add the size of the extension data as 3 bytes (little-endian),
followed by a set of bits telling which extensions we're incorporating.
The data then _preceeds_ this trailing tags.

This is all experimental, and you'll need to have
'#define WEBP_EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURES' in webp/types.h to enable this code
(at your own risk! :))

Still, this hack produces almost-valid WebP file for decoders that don't
check this color_space bit. In particular, previous 'dwebp' (and for instance
Chrome) will recognize this files and decode them, but without the alpha
of course. Other decoder will just see random extra stuff at the end of
partition #0.

To experiment with the alpha-channel, you need to compile on Unix platform
and use PNGs for input/output.

If 'alpha.png' is a source with alpha channel, then you can try (on Unix):

  cwebp alpha.png -o alpha.webp
  dwebp alpha.webp -o test.png

cwebp now has a '-noalpha' flag to ignore any alpha information from the
source, if present.

More hacking and experimenting welcome!

decoding state. The flow is typically:

   WebPIDecoder* const idec = WebPINew(mode);

     status = WebPIAppend(idec, new_data, new_data_size);

Doing so, one can try and decode new macroblocks everytime fresh
bytes are available.
There's two operating modes: either appending fresh bytes, or
updating the whole buffer with additional data in the end.
The latter requires less memcpy()'s

step if loop_filter_level is 0, which is _not_ equivalent to performing
the loop-filtering with a 0 value for loop_filter_level. In the latter case
(which we followed), few pixels were modified here and there and you could
observe off-by-1 errors on few places.

This patch will reconcile the 3 implementations (since the difference
is minor, skipping the deblocking step will save CPU for virtually
no visible difference).

The spec will be made clearer about the expected behaviour:
* if the global loop_filter_level is 0, turn deblocking off.
* if it's not 0 but the local loop_filter_level ends up being 0 for whatever
reason (lf_delta, mode delta, ref delta, etc.) on a particular
macroblock, skip the deblocking too.

the U/V chroma fields. The filter used is a separable t[1 3 3 1] x [1 3 3 1]
filter. It can be easily changed in macros MIX_*.

The upscaling code reside on the thing shell between user and core
decoding (in webp.c), and not in the core decoder. As such, this smoothing
process can still be offloaded to GPU in some future and is not integral
part of the decoding process.

Coincidentaly: changed the way data is tranfered to user. For profile 2 (no
filtering), it used to be on a per-block basis. Now, for all profiles, we
emit rows of pixels (between 8 and 24 in height) when they are ready.
This makes the upscaling code much easier.

Will update the test vectors MD5 sums soon (as they'll be broken
after this change)
