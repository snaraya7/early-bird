There were many mistakes or at least traps, where e.g. member variables were used instead of a given parameter. The JFrame showing the Tooltip image is not always adapated to the size of the image to show. The location of the JFrame is either defined by the input ports of TooltipInstance or automatically captured from the current mouse position.

The following things must be checked and changed:
* Are the properties propInitX and propInitY really necessary?
* Should the events elpNextTooltip and elpPrevTooltip also select the image and send out the imagefilename or not?

* added registry patch to prevent power-save-mode on starting FS20 sender

* AsTeRICS does not have to run in with admin privileges to apply registry-patch -> patch triggers own UAC-control-dialog, registry patch is only applied when needed

* reformat code

* added automatic reopen of fs20-device if sending of action fails of device is closed. with this adaption it is possible to disconnect/reconnect the fs20-device during runtime without errors and sending data after reconnect without problems.

* added timeout at sending data to fs20. prevents errors when fs20 is connected in power-save-mode and does not work

only send the measured time in case of a received stop event:
TimerInstance.receiveEvent calls TimeGenerator.stopAndSendData

TimerInstance.stop method calls TimeGenerator.stop method which does not send the data

*) Additionally removed synchronized keywords because the receiveEvent methods can only be called by the model executor thread and the TimeGenerator can only be called from TimerInstance
*) Cleaned up TimeGenerator.start method and remove endless loop waiting for runThread != null

Notes:
The test model still produces a ConcurrentModificationException when iterating through the event listeners in DefaultRuntimeEventTriggeredPort. But without a remarkable side effect. Nevertheless this should be investigated and exceptions should be catched within the for loop of event notification to not effect other notifications.

#Determines size of model executor thread pool. If 0 or 1, the single-threaded approach is used. If > 1 the multi-threaded approach is used with a pool of the given size.
ThreadPool.ModelExecutor.size=0
#The size of the thread pool for other tasks like CIM communication. This pool is used by many plugin to perform some ""parallel"" tasks
ThreadPool.OtherTasks.size=10
#Maximum time in milliseconds to wait until a blocked execution in the model executor thread is timed out.
