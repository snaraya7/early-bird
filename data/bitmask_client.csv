- build openvpn, export the binaries for further processing
- correct openvpn dependencies, fetch tap installer compatible with openvpn just built
- install tap-driver with nsis
- pyinstaller-build: fix mixed mkdir / show errors if there are some
- installer-build: prepare rw-copy, do not expose nsh files
- add openvpn_leap.exe to install directory so it gets picked up by nsis
- use setup.py to install bitmask to site-packages to have a version
- separate build directories for granular make
- copy all openvpn dlls to installer
- die to signal failure to parent makefile
- cache installDependencies for quick turn-arround times
- share openssl version between openvpn and pysqlcipher/other pip builds
- collect files during prepare for installer
- default to eip:false, mail:true

This falls in the ""quick"" workaround category.

A proper state machine that extends the four basic connection states
is hence needed. We have to accomodate design to have a
connection-oriented state machine in the backend (I would favor a
twisted protocol for this), and a more lightweight one that conducts
the gui-level changes (ie, change the actions / buttons / labels
accordingly).

Since this ""cancel"" functionality has been long postponed, I chose
to do one more ugly hack here, that is, show and hide dance with a
button that just calls the bitmask-root to kill the vpn process. It
should work well enough until we get to the reorganization needed for a
clean process control for eip.

This is related to research #4190 and #4083.
I didn't resolve them, but I ended understanding a bit more what kind
of issues can we be having with those.
This workaround is more than anything a cleanup on that for future work,
and is making me able to test the client much more nicely inside a
virtualenv (where the default keyring selecting was the plaintext one).

For this to work inside a virtualenv, one have to install SecureStorage,
which in turns depends on python-dbus, which is basically uninstallable
using pip inside a venv. So, symlinking to the rescue!

it needs gi/repository and pyobject to be symlinked too.
but at least you don't have to type the pass every time.

I don't know what should be do in the long term with this issue.
Some of us were not too fond on using the keyrings at all.
We don't have many options among all the keyring backends, and sadly
many of them depend on PyCrypto. So probably roll our own backend. Yay.
