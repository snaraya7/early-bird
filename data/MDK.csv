  MAGICDRAW-470 Code cleanup and added LockActions
  Update UpdateClientElementAction.java
  ElementValidator  - updated override to indicate failure for manual element update of non-locked elements rather than disabling the action. Correctly indicates failure for non-locked elements on bulk update. UpdateClientElementAction  - Added ValidationRuleViolation generating function for use in override (as in the above manual import use case for non-locked elements)  - Supporting changes to accomodate the alternate VRV generation cases  - Fixed unsynced bug in UpdateClientElementAction arising from re-enabling the listener before the importer had completed  - Modified to always run the bulk importer to avoid edge cases EMFBulkImporter  - Always returns a changelog, but will sometimes return an empty one.
  Blocked update of locked elements on manual validation.
  Update EMFExporter.java
  missed a commit file
  Added jms ignore for locked elements to ensure conflict arises properly.
  Replaced ModelElementsManager#remove calls with deeper api methods in order to better manage locked elements.
  MAGICDRAW-740 #comment Relying on EMF method to perform element updates in model. Testing project#removeElementByID() for element removal. Supporting changes.

  MAGICDRAW-437 #comment Cleaned up.
  Added branch properties to temporalDiff stereotype
  Unused code
  Added tag name for branches, still require either workspace id from mms (not workspace/branch name). Switched compareToTime and baseVersionTime (it seems more intuitive that mms-version-one be the base version).
  Wrong file in previous commit
  Initial commit w. stereotype changes

  MDEV-260 instead of turning cache on/off, just reset the cache for user events so that it will discover new and updated blackbox shortcuts
  MDEV-260 caching blackbox functions during validation and for nested calls to avoid slowdown in rediscovering them
  MDEV-260 fixed 2 bugs; seems to work now
  MDEV-260 changes for user-defined black box functions, untested
  fixed stereotype shortcut s() to filter properly when passed an argument
  minor addition of code comments
  fixed regexMatch() OCL shortcut; added some extra error handling
  showing OclInvalid when that is the eval result in the OCL test tool
  fixed ERR message in message window, which was triggering on the wrong condition; also removed some other debug output (e.g., w=null) that inadvertently shows up when printing debug for Ocl evaluation test tool.
  Refactoring Debug to remove MagicDraw import and starting to fix regex() OCL shortcut

  fix wrong cast exception

  commenting new code recently committed in Utils and Common
  fix to make tag values uneditable; cleanup of get*Property*() functions
  added call to parse() in initialize; null check for bNode
  fixing null pointer exception It seems like we should have found this one long ago--should check if we need to hotfix.
  added noSections and excludeViews to Product stereotype, removed Generalization to Volume
  making tables editable also some changes and questions about hasStereotype() and hasStereotypeDerived()
  move initialize things to table
  added sortable customization
  updated docgen activity diagram palette
  fix sorting reverse option
  added sorting stereotypes to profile cleanup sysml extensions doc profile
  cleanup some sort code
  clean up the refactor
  This is a commit
  Refactored templates to implement Generatable, which simplifies parseTemplate in DocumentGenerator, and included sorting by attributes (Name, Documentation, and Value) and by properties. The functionality of TableStructure that grabs attributes and properties from a particular cell has been moved to Utils for general use.
  Did a little bit of sorting. Modified the name-definition profile, but should eventually modify SysML extentions to reflect, once changes are approved.
  Took all the DocumentElement visitor stuff for TS out of DocBookOutputVisitor and put it in the TS class.
  TableStructures are now treated the same way as Templates. Also, TableStructure, AttributeColumn, and PropertyColumn can all be expressed as either a StructuredNode or a CallBehaviorAction.

  cleanup some sort code
  clean up the refactor
  This is a commit
  Refactored templates to implement Generatable, which simplifies parseTemplate in DocumentGenerator, and included sorting by attributes (Name, Documentation, and Value) and by properties. The functionality of TableStructure that grabs attributes and properties from a particular cell has been moved to Utils for general use.
  Did a little bit of sorting. Modified the name-definition profile, but should eventually modify SysML extentions to reflect, once changes are approved.
  Took all the DocumentElement visitor stuff for TS out of DocBookOutputVisitor and put it in the TS class.
  TableStructures are now treated the same way as Templates. Also, TableStructure, AttributeColumn, and PropertyColumn can all be expressed as either a StructuredNode or a CallBehaviorAction.
  Modularizing DocumentGenerator!

* commit '8a3f66bed8f99f65f2ecea62bb8bc50cf9631068':
  Teamwork lock checks implemented. Ready to distribute.
  Right-click menu option now appears on actual target diagram.
  Both validation fixes - auto and manual pattern load - now implemented.
  Checking and syncing all styles via validation UI now working nominally.
  Skeleton of PatternValidation class added.
  Pattern stamp elements are now saved to the target diagram's parent.
  Pattern stamping now implemented.
  Pattern loading via viewpoint conformance is now implemented.
  Pattern Loader action now only shows up on diagram symbol right-click with correct viewpoint conform/package dependency layout.
  Pattern loading no longer changes symbol bounds or path break points.
  Working, but the code is ugly. Time to refactor.
  Currently working on support for loading children.
  Menu fixed (in alphabetical order now too). Need to add support for saving pattern strings for child elements.
  Pattern loading is now working nominally. Need to reshape the input menu.
  Switching branches for a bit.
  Switching to another branch for a moment.
  Moving back to style-saver for a bit.
  First commit - pattern saving

  don't use simple list in CustomTable
  configurator issues
  Behaviors work! Curly braces are great.
  Fixed the default cases
  fixed bug where table entry could be added incorrectly to list; renamed some functions in Common
  Fixed all the methods
  update to behavior handling
  merge fix
  better handling of off-nominal case
  fixing merge mistake so that files match those in develop
  changing default for slot2String to include the name of the slot since slot values are expanded into a DBList in Common.getEntryFromObject().
  Exposing slot values so that they are listed in DBList like other multi-valued properties.
  support for TableExpressionColumn and some error checking in TableStructure
  preliminary support for nested behaviors and lists; chickened out for view editor
  minor addition of evaluateQuery() function that uses default verbose flag
  not printing name of slot in slot2String() by default; added flag to make the name optional
  minor - added yet unused getSlotValues() method
  minor refactoring
  some minor edits for a modified OCL parser
  Includes the AttributeColumn and PropertyColumn but don't put behaviors on things or you'll get a NullPointerException in CollectFilter.

  ocl test plugin
  Deleted corrupted files
  Unchanging unintentional commit of classpath
  removed something
  Now collects property values and handles non-numerical default values
  test OCL query dialog updated for repeated use and memory of past queries
  Changed non-numerical sum placeholder from ""no entry"" to ""--"" because it's more unobtrusive.
  TableSumRows now work!
  This is a cool commit.
  CustomTable with OCL text for columns works at least partly. Test cases not checked in.
  added CustomTable stereotype
  Initial support for OCL in tables for CustomTable.
