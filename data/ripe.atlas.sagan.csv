at this point ;-)

Apparently, there's some [known
issues](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/4794) with how
Travis handles multiple Python environments.  So after some poking I
realised that the testing strategy we were using was redundant anyway:
We were using tox to build python environments in each Travis container
-- containers that were already being spun up for specific Python
versions.

This commit drops the use of tox in Travis (though it keeps the
`tox.ini` file for local development & testing) and instead instructs
Travis to run the tests natively after installing Sagan in the
container.
