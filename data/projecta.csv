If you build projecta from scratch, pip will fail because latest

The (by Pandoc) generated table rst has some many troubles compiling
in sphinx that it is better to not add it here.
In newer version of qgis.org changelogs the sponsors will be inserted
via runtime javascript injections

So back to full images for now.

I fixed the issues by adding lines like this in each place where we use the user factory:

        # Something changed in the way factoryboy works with django 1.8
        # I think - we need to explicitly set the users password
        # because the core.model_factories.UserF._prepare method
        # which sets the password is never called. Next two lines are
        # a work around for that - sett #581
        self.user.set_password('password')
        self.user.save()

There are still some tests failing due to missing css and js libs - will try to address those in a separate PR.

Fix #581
