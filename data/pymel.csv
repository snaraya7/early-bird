would be shared by all LazyLoadModules.  This is what happened with
pymel.core.uitypes - it installed it's lazy-load attrs on the base class,
LazyLoadModule.  pymel.core.nodetypes used it's own subclass -
NodetypesLazyLoadModule - but since that inherited from LazyLoadModule, the
net effect was that nodetypes had all the uitypes accessible from it's
namespace.

Since this bug has been out there for a while, I'm manually installing all

formerly, mel wraps would interpret a missing entry in the override data as
meaning there was no api wrap, instead of checking upstream, as it should.
However, this change necessicated some other cascading changes to how mel
wraps work.

The net was that some more mel methods got wrapped than were formerly -
though all these cases seem desirable.  We did rename some methods, though,
to avoid confusion (ie, having both attr() and attribute(), that did
different things, would be confusing).  To prevent future wraps from
creating such confusion, added attribute/addAttribute/removeAttribute to
list of excluded methods.

formerly, getRotateOrientation was set to disable, and 'useName' of

seemed like too much work - particularly since we call factories.*

returned by the getter.

Technically, an api function with no args could be it's own do and undo,
if it was a ""toggle"" type function... however, we currently have no way of
detecting that. So we assume a func with no args is not undoable.

This has no change in behavior, since no functions that were actually

because data descriptors require items to be installed
at the class level, and an instance of LazyLoadModule
was used directly in the pymel.core.uitypes module, this
meant that all it's lazy members were installed directly
on the LazyLoadModule base class.  Thus,
pymel.core.nodetypes inherited them (even though IT used
a subclass, NodetypesLazyLoadModule, so IT'S members
weren't visible to uitypes).
The fix would have been to enforce creation of
subclasses, probably throuhg LazyLoadModule.__new__;
however, as the class isn't used anymore, not bothering
with this fix.

Debated not including these members, but there
is a decent chance someone was using them, even if on
accident, so we decided to include them

the ""import pymel.core as pm"" added an entry to maybe_modules... then when looking up the classname for
pm.uitypes.AETemplate, pymel.core.uitypes / pm.uitypes wasn't in maybe_modules (though pm was) - and
the import statement didn't get triggered

now we check if the parent module (in this case, pymel.core / pm) is in maybe_modules, and use it's import
text if so.

Note that (to be safe) we still need to add a ""import pymel.core.uitypes"" line, to ensure that "".uitypes"" exists
on pymel.core (though in this particular case, this isn't necessary, in general, it might be)

We recently investigated the exceptions that are thrown when we launch Maya and found out that there is one exception coming from a PyMEL script. In pymel/api/plugins.py, we found that you are trying to pass a non-existing flag to the pluginInfo command. The flag is:
'contextCommand': {}, # currently no pluginInfo flag for this in any version, but I'm an optimist...

We investigated the matter, and found out that the ‘tool’ flag is doing what you probably are looking for. It will return the tool context commands. I have to admit the flag name is a bit confusing, and maybe you thought that it would return the tool commands proper. It turns out that tool commands are already part of the “regular” commands and are returned when you use the ‘command’ flag (you already do).
So long story short we replaced ‘contextCommand’ with ‘tool’ in plugins.py on our side, and it got rid of that one exception.

api.conversions:
    consolidated code for doing dgMod / dagMod 'trick' into '_makeDgModGhostObject' function
        also, we now call dagMod/dgMod.deleteNode for created nodes, as otherwise we will litter scene with
        'junk nodes' when loading a scene that requires a plugin; also, try dgMod BEFORE dagMod, as this
        avoids creating a junk transform
    _buildMayaReservedTypes: updated plugin node types, misc other additions
    _parentFn: made dagMod/dgMod args mandatory (since no default ones were actually created)
    _buildApiTypeHierarchy: added apiClassInfo kwarg, so we can reuse an existing apiClassInfo
    _buildApiCache: added rebuildAllButClassInfo kwarg:
        Set 'rebuildAllButClassInfo' to True to force rebuilding of all info BUT apiClassInfo -
        this is useful for versions < 2009, as these versions cannot parse the api docs; by setting
        this to False, you can rebuild all other api information.

core.windows:
    changed wrapper type from MetaMayaNodeWrapper to MetaMayaUIWrapper

core.pmtypes.factories:
    Redid MetaMayaWrapper hierarchy: made _MetaMayaCommandWrapper a base
        class of MetaMayaNodeWrapper and a new metaclass, MetaMayaUIWrapper,
        and put stuff specific to nodes / ui commands in each
        Also, added __melnode__ / __melui__ attributes to the generated classes,
            which give the underlying node name / ui command - this allows for
            correct operation even if the maya node name is capitalized, or we
            wish to link the PyNode to a mel command with a completely different name
    use util.warn instead of warnings.warn
    getInheritance: made default return value an empty list (instead of None)

util.pwarnings:
    warn: added custom util.warn which uses our custom ExecutionWarning as the default warning (instead of UserWarning)

Made core modules import mayahook.pmcmds instead of maya.cmds
     (changed animation, general, language, rendering, system, and windows modules)

__init__:
	Added final import at end of pymel.__init__ to make sure pymel.cmds == maya.cmds

core.animation:
	_constraint: fixed bug with new weight query syntax
	made various constraints use _constraint to generate them
	
core.general:
	removed various calls to stringify, as no longer necessary (stringify-ing is handled in pmcmds)
	disconnectAttr: fixed bug with disconnecting all connections (ie, destination==None)
	listConnections: modified makePairs to use util.pairIter
	moved def. of ProxyUnicode to util.utilitytypes, so it can be accesed by util.arguments / mayahook.pmcmds
	PyNode.nodeType: fixed
	Attribute.__apimobject__: fixed
	Attribute.__apimfn__: small clarity, code consolidation change
	Attribute.nodeName: duplicate definition removed
	Attribute.type: now returns u""message"" if the attribute is a message attribute
	Attribute.isMessageType: added method
	IkHandle: added class, with jointList and endEffector methods
	
core.language:
	conditionExists: added function to test existence of a condition (ie, the type of condition tested by isTrue, not a condition node)
	
factories.factories:
	getInheritance: now properly deletes node when it is itself a transform node, but has no parents
	_addCmdDocs: now tries to lookup cmdInfo if not fed it, and checks that the function isn't a runtime command
	functionFactory: now imports commands from pmcmds instead of maya.cmds by default
		fixed bug with trying to create unicode function names
		better handling of non-function callable objects
		no longer rename functions in-place (would result in mismatch between module's __dict__ and function's __name__)
		refactored code for clarity / less code duplication
	pluginLoaded/UnloadedCallback: updates pmcmds
	
mayahook.mayautils:
	getRunningMayaVersion: refactored duplicate code into this new function
	mayaIsRunning: code clarity wrapper for getRunningMayaVersion
	getMayaExecutable: keyword argument name changed from 'batch' to 'commandLine' for clarity
		checks to make sure it doesn't return python executable (if it did, _getVersionStringFromExecutable will hang)
	mayaDocsLocation: now uses mayaIsRunning for clarity / avoid a catch-all except
	mayaInit: now uses getRunningMayaVersion / mayaIsRunning
	
mayahook.pmcmds:
	New module!
	wraps the commands in maya.cmds to accept PyNode arguments, for versions prior to 2009
	
mayahook.test_pmcmds:
	New module!
	various unittests to make sure PyNode args are stringified
	
util.arguments:
	isIterable: now correctly checks for objects that implement __getitem__, but not __iter__
	stringify: heavily modified for use in pmcmds
		now has optional keyword for recursion limiting
		can now maintain dictionaries, instead of converting to a list (and therefore losing values)
		can now be told to only stringify objects that are instances of specified classes
	stringifyPyNodeArgs: new decorator which will convert any PyNode arguments to unicode strings
	argsToPyNodes: decorator generator used to convert arguments INTO PyNodes (ie, opposite of stringifyPyNodeArgs)
	pairIter: new function which iterates over a list in 'pairs' - used to process results of listConnections

util.arrays:
	Vector.projectionOnto: new method to find the projection of one vector onto another
	
util.testingutils:
	new module!
	TestCaseExtended: new class, extends unittest.TestCase, contains msic. useful methods 
	permutations: (should be moved to util.math?)

util.test_testingutils:
    new module!
    unittests for testingutils

util.utilitytypes:
    ProxyUnicode moved here so it can be accessed from util.arguments / mayahook.pmcmds

misc changes to use os-correct path seperators
api.conversions:
        ApiDocParser.getClassFilename: finds correct filename for 2008 help
               files as well as 2009
        ApiDocParser.__init__: default 'version' set to 'None', in which case
               current version is used (so can call 'getMFnInfo' from 2008)

core.general:
        Mel.eval now returns a value, like maya.mel.eval

factories.factories:
        getInheritence: when a dag node is created to test it's inheritence,
               the extra transform node above it that is also created is deleted

mayahook.envparse:
        parse: MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH, MAYA_MODULE_PATH, and XBMLANGPATH
               added to list of variables that maya will append to

mayahook.mayautil:
        getMayaVersion: if maya not running, retrieves version info from
               calling the command-line executable with ""-v"" switch,
               instead of parsing the directory tree
        mayaDocsLocation: if maya is running, now queries maya for the correct
                location of the documentation instead of ""guessing"" the default
                installation path
        added getMayaExecutable function to retrieve the path to the maya binary
        added executableOutput / shellOutput functions for easier / more
                os-independent way of retrieving information from command-line
                commands (mainly, because commands.getouptut not supported on
                windows)
        refreshEnviron: now works on windows, as it doesn't use
                commands.getoutput

tools.mel2py.melparse:
        proc_remap: conversion of the mel 'system' command now uses
                mayahook.mayautil.shellOutput, so it works on windows (and it
                also gives results that match the original mel command better)

tools.scriptEditor.pymelScrollFieldReporter:
        calls the ""build"" method on the mparser, so it can actually parse!
