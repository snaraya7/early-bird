After `strace`ing the hell out of `expect`, I've determined that `expect`'s `wait` command hangs up on the system-under-test (`SIGHUP`), which, in many circumstances, just aborts the PHP script and just returns an exit code of 0. I haven't been able to determine why it did work on Ubuntu, yet not on Mac. It does appear that the `wait` command is not made specifically for making assertions about the spawned process' exit code.nnTo address the issue, I have replaced the `wait` command with an `expect` command call which expects a certain magic string, which contains the exit code, to appear. While it is a hack, it is very reliable, and someone must be out for breaking things if he/she would use this magic string in QA Tools' output.n",True,Corrective,True,False,,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,17.0,17.0,"tests/system/harness.tcl,CAS_DELIMITER",116.0,10.0,38.26880787037037,6.0,910.0,1.0261309420295337,275.0,0.0,112
