Reason:
google_instance_setup starts sshd after generating host keys, but when
FreeBSD boots, this service starts before sshd.
FreeBSD starts sshd through rc utility on boot regardless if
it was already started before. Causing the following error:

```

nss_cache_oslogin is intended to be used with the libnss-cache nss module.
This simply queries OSLogin and stores a local cache of the results,
which are then looked up by the libnss-cache module.

The cache binary is intented to be run periodically to sync with the
database. NSS should be configured to first check the cache, then fall
back on the OSLogin module if the entry is missing. This also means
account data can potentially be stale.

Note that getpwent_r() is no longer implemented for nss_oslogin. We rely
solely on the cache for this call. This is because getpwent will iterate
through all databases, and having both oslogin and cache databases
configured will cause user entries to be listed twice. The cache with a
fallback behavior only works for getpwnam/getpwuid.

* Update the name of the cache backup file.

Prevents potential conflicts with /etc/passwd backups.

The version of dhclient-script included in Debian Wheezy uses /bin/bash

dash).  This is fixed in Jessie, but that fix breaks this script, which
depends upon bash.

This change fixes the script to work under dash and bash equally, and
also removes the executable bit (as the script is intended to be

server to know which accounts to examine. It ignored all other accounts.
This means that, when the last reference to an account was removed from
the metadata server, the final SSH key would linger untouched.

Now, enumerate all accounts on the system (as revealed by the system's
passwd database). If an account has a ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file but
was not reflected in the metadata server, run our key update routine
with an empty list of SSH keys to remove any added-by-Google keys that
may be present.

I successfully tested this on a backports Debian image, by killing the
running daemon, copying over the files, starting the daemon, ensuring it
could create a new user as before, and ensuring it deletes that user's
only key after the user is removed from the metadata server.
