- added a method ""verify_tests_have_capture_groups"" to
  lib/recog/fingerprint.rb which loops over the parameters provided by
  a fingerprint, finds the parameters that are defined by capture
  groups, and then makes sure there is at least one example for each
  parameter defined by a capture group
- added tests to spec/lib/recog/fingerprint_spec.rb to make sure the
  ""verify_tests_have_capture_groups"" method behaves as expected

  defines different types of fingerprints used to exercise tests in
