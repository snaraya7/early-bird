- walkingParams.txt is now copied from the Matlab script of the planner

A first use is to load a single set of gains. In this case, if no other options are specified, this gains are used for the duration of the module. During module closure the original gains are applied.
This should allow to launch torque balancing with different set of gains depending on the application (single foot, yoga) thus solving the last obstacle to do torquebalancing on the new ethernet robots.

A different use case is the possibility to load different set of gains at startup. It is then possible to switch between gains by using a newly introduced RPC command.
Further debug is need before considering a run-time switch of the gains, so this feature should be considere EXPERIMENTAL

In the mean time it added support to obtain velocity and acceleration from the smoothing generator (currently not used).
Also added a constant reader.
Fixed some warnings
Fixed also an issue with the impedance generator: because the generator simply outputs a reference (so it is not a controller), when it is activated the smoother starts from 0.
Without smoothing this would not have been a problem, but the smoother in this way starts from zero and in T time it reaches 90% of the reference, which is not the desired behaviour.
I now added an option to force the generator to reset the filter to have the same value of the reference, instead of zero.
