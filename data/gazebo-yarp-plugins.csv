Add basic integration test for the position control and the velocity control.
The test simulates a simple one dof model (a pendulum) with a joint actuated
by a gazebo_yarp_controlboard, and uses the remote_controlboard and the controlboardwrapper2
to specify a position first and velocity setpoint later, and verify that the
simulated robot reaches the requested setpoints. To avoid the need to
run the yarpserver externally, the test uses YARP in local mode.

to support compilation against Gazebo 6 that required C++11, and unfortunately since then Gazebo did not switch to a modern
way of specifying C++ standard requirement in consuming libraries. Now that YARP requires C++14, passing GAZEBO_CXX_FLAGS 
(that contains -std=c++11) basically bypass the CMake logic to compute the correct C++ standard with which to compile the plugins,
and forces to compile them with C++11. 

As the only reason for which GAZEBO_CXX_FLAGS was added to CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS was to enable C++11 support, and as that is already 
passed as a requirement by YARP, I think we can just remove it.

Reads the contact forces and torques at the gazebo collision level through a gazebo ContactSensor plugin
Finds an equivalent wrench acting at the CG of the specified link (location CG, rotation link origin frame)
Transforms the equivalent wrench to the origin of the specified link
Maps the equivalent wrench to an array of contact normal forces acting at the load cell locations

The mapping problem is an infinite solution problem and is done using a pseudo-inverse to get the
results with the minimized norm.

This model plugin in its current version assumes a single collision element per link
This model plugin in its current version handles only one link with a plugin instance (multiple links cannot be specified per plugin)
The collision name should be set to the {link_name}_collision in the contact sensor added to the specific link in the urdf/sdf

Gazebo class GazeboYarpContactLoadCellArray
Yarp Device Driver GaeboYarpContactLoadCellArrayDriver

The device driver read method sends a timeout signal if the data is not ready

Added documentation and comments on how to use .ini file and parameter settings

Supporting both gazebo 7 and gazebo 8

contactpressuresensorsarray changes after first PR review
main change
- equivalent contact wrenches act at the location of link Center of Gravity, with rotation same as
  link origin frame
- Added a CoP check function to compare equivalent wrench and mapped forces

Added documentation for issue concerning support for nested models

With this change, we integrate directly the gazebo PIDs inside the code and we only command Force (or torque) to the joint.
As a second step we might think of removing the gazebo PID, but for now it seems a good compromise.

Otherwise the [PART_DRIVER] parameters were not parsed correctly - fixed post-insertion of robot scoped name in the [PART_DRIVER] group - fixed the LUT which mapps the part name to the size of the output buffer - added decoding of the sensor type from its decomposed name:   (acc_xxx, gyro_xxx) - refactored driver open method - completed the building of the output buffer metadata.

The commit depends on a feature developed in the ""devel"" branch of
YARP, while the master branch of ""gazebo-yarp-plugins"" should remain
compatible with the ""master"" branch of YARP.

For this reason a ""devel"" branch compatible with the ""devel"" branch of YARP
has been created, with the reverted commit.
