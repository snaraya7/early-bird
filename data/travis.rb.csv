the API (`/auth/github`) before we know whether or not it has sufficient
scopes.

If the token has correct scopes, API returns `access_token` we can use.
If the token does not have sufficient scopes, at the moment, it is a
redirect, which, when followed, is a success (200) but with unusable
data.
As `#post_raw` returns a String in such a case (`JSON.parse` fails and
body is returned), so we'll just ensure that the response was what we
expect.

Using url.<remote>.insteadOf, one may create shorthand URLs (such as
work:project to stand in for git@github.com:MyCompany/project).  This
patch uses ls-remote to resolve the alias for such URLS to their
actual destination, which allows the gem to correctly determine the
slug for the repo.  ls-remote --get-url has been present since
Git v1.7.5, so hopefully that's old enough.
