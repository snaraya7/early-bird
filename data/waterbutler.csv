   b/c a user uploading a moderately-sized file (~20Mb or greater)

   With this change, a user uploading a medium-to-large file (~20Mb -

   uploading a *very* large file (~1Gb+) might still get an ambiguous
   error.

   This is an ugly and disgusting hack.  It would be *much* better to
   abort the reading/writing of the upload stream so we don't have to

   stop it w/o causing unrecoverable errors.

this issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/31470,

Fortunately, the bug was fixed in GLv10.0 so that download has been
written to use the preferred and intuitive approach.

In addition, the hack would not work with aiohttp3 even if we kept it.
It needs to modify response headers directly within the object before
passing it to the response stream reader. aiohttp3 makes this
impossible: the `headers` attr is defined as a `@reify` property.  The
cache effect of `@reify` prevents modifying either `_headers` or
`headers`.

  or any working provider including figshare fails. The problem is
  that the downloaded stream from the src-provider  has a None size
  during copy / move, which  breaks the upload-to-dest step which
  requires the size.

* The root problem: the download response for private files using
  the figshare API does not provide the Content-Length header that
  is used to build the response stream and to set the stream size.
  On the contrary, the download response for published files using
  figshare's backend S3 API provides the Content-Length header.

* The fix is to retrieve and save the file size in advance during

    still had to use the latter for streaming requests probably due to

    (async with ... as ...) has been replaced with its non-CM counter-
    part. Please note that self.request() was removed from the core
    provider during osfstorage/googlecloud upgrade.

  - Removed redundant json.dumps() on request data
  - --retry -> retry -= 1 for chunked upload try loop
  - Style updates: more compact (less blank lines), added comma for

   data to the new region and update the file metadata entry on the
   OSF.  osfstorage cross-region moves are wonky b/c they can't use
   intra_move (which won't copy the data), and they can't use the
   default move (which will create all-new file metadata entries on
   the OSF, losing guids and versions in the process).

   This method is a direct copy-and-paste of `BaseProvider.move` but
   with minor modification at the end to support the above.  Moves to
   another provider are sent to the parent `move` method, which will
   suffice.  Moves within the same region (those for which
   `can_intra_move` is `True`) are still dispatched to
   `intra_move`. Only moves between two osfstorage providers with
   different storage buckets are affected.

   single request.  Some providers support uploading larger files by
   ""chunking"" uploads: breaking a file into multiple pieces, uploading
   them individually, then reassembling them on the providers side.
   Each provider sets its own limit on the max size of a single chunk,
   but usually they are multi-megabyte chunks.

   WB receives a single stream during an upload.  To chunk this
   without downloading and manually partitioning the file requires a
   stream reader class that can read up to `n` bytes, then stop
   without closing the original stream.  The WB stream classes inherit
   from `asyncio.StreamReader`, whose `readexactly(n)` and `read(n)`
   methods appear to support this use case.  They do, sort of.  They
   attempt to read all `n` bytes into a chunk in memory before sending
   it off the the provider.  This means that 1) uploading a 10 Mb
   chunk requires 10 Mb of memory, and 2) all 10 Mb must be fetched
   from the uploader before being sent.  1 could quickly lead to
   memory exhaustion in WB if multiple uploads happen at the same
   time.  2 can cause uploads to fail. If the uploader is slow to send
   data to WB and fill the chunk, the receiving provider may close the
   connection as inactive.

   The solution is to continuously send smaller subchunks of data to
   the provider, terminating after the overall chunk size is reached.
   This is actually how the `asyncio.StreamReader.read()` method is
   intended to function, but confusion between what `read()` calls a
   chunk size and what the provider calls a chunk size led to failures
   in cross-provider move/copies into Figshare, the only provider at
   the time of this commit that supports chunked uploads.

   The new CutoffStream class takes an existing stream object and the
   provider-given chunk size (superchunk) and continuously reads and
   feeds subchunks.  After each subchunk read, a bytes-thus-far
   counter is updated.  The CutoffStream stops reading when
   bytes-thus-far equals the superchunk size.  Only subchunk bytes of
   data are stored in memory at a time.

   Since googlecloud urls are signed and can expire, it must delay
   generation until right before issuing.  Otherwise, if the first
   request fails, the second may not get issued until after the
   signature has expired.

   Unfortunately, `.make_request` was evoking the url function outside

 * osfstorage is being updated to include a flag in file metadata that
   will indicate if the requesting user has seen the most recent
   version of the file.  To help the OSF properly determine this,
   update WB to send along the requesting user's id when asking for
   the metadata of all files in a given directory.

   The requesting user is not the same as the authorizing user.  If
   Barbara asks for the contents of an osfstorage directory created by
   Alice, Barbara is the *requesting* user, while Alice is the
   *authorizing* user.  WB first verifies that Barbara has the
   necessary access to the file, but uses a shared secret to retrieve
   metadata about the file.  This change is necessary to inform the
   OSF who is behind the request.

 * The osfstorage folder children response is updated to include a new
   flag, `latestVersionSeen`.  If this flag is `null`, the requesting
   user has never seen *any* version of the file.  If it is `true`,
   the user has seen the latest version of the file.  If it is
   `false`, the user has seen a previous version of the file, but not
   the most recent one.  This flag will be exposed through the
   `extra.latestVersionSeen` flag in OsfStorageFileMetadata.

 * Due to a quirk in WB and the OSF, the latestVersionSeen flag will
   only be correctly set on the responses from folder metadata list
   requests.  Neither service correctly handles requests for
   previous-version metadata for individual files.

 * Update tests to include latestVersionSeen in children response.

   returning one more byte than requested due to a misunderstanding of
   how a utility library worked.  The issue manifested as the
   inability of Safari to play videos from WB.  @abought and
   @Johnetordoff discovered that Safari makes a two-byte range request
   before playing the file.  WB was returning a three-byte response,
   causing Safari to refuse to play the videos.

 * Teach WB to release partial responses.  A side effect of fixing the
   range handling was that partial responses were never reaching their
   EOF.  Streams only signal EOF when a read is issued after the feed
   has been exhausted.  Since partial response return exactly the
   number of bytes within them, this never occurs.

 * Add Range header support to Figshare, GitLab, and the filesystem
   providers.  Bitbucket, GitLab, and Dataverse do not support this
   header and will continue to return full responses if received.

 * Add range header support tests for all providers that support them.

 * Add logger modules to all providers.

 * These changes are only being made for v1.  v0 is deprecated and is
   expected to be removed soon.

 in 5fdc63f2d41e.  The commit message has been updated to better
 reflect the intention and implementation.>

 Over the life of WB, the github provider has accepted the following
 parameters to identify the ref (commit or branch) that the path
 entity is to be found on: ""ref"", ""branch"", ""version"", ""sha"",
 ""revision"".  Worse, sometimes the values are commit SHAs and other
 times are branch names.  Worserer (sic), some queries contain two or
 three of these parameters at the same time.

 WB strives to maintain backcompat, so the following method tries to
 divine the user intention as much as possible, using the following
 heuristics:

 * If both a commit SHA and branch name are provided, the commit SHA
   should be used, since it is more specific.

 * Each parameter will be checked.  If present and not equal to the
   empty string, it will be run through the _looks_like_sha method
   to decide whether it is a SHA or branch name.

 * The order in which the query parameters are tested differs for
   commit SHAs and branches. The order for commit SHAs from highest
   precedence to lowest precedence is: ""ref"", ""version"", ""sha"",
   ""revision"".  ""ref"" is returned in the action links for file and
   folder metadata, and so takes precendence.  ""version"" is the most
   common parameter, used heavily in the OSF.  ""sha"" occurs
   occasionally, but despite the name can be either a commit SHA or
   branch name. ""revision"" does not appear to be in regular use
   anymore, but has cropped up in development in old metadata entries.

 * The order for branch names from highest priority to lowest priority
   is: ""branch"", ""ref"", ""version"", ""sha"", ""revision"". ""branch"" is used
   by fangorn and so far appears to always be a branch name.  The
   others follow the same priority for commit SHAs.

 * If none of the query parameters are present or contain a valid
   commit SHA/branch name, WB will fall back to the default branch
   for the repo.

 WB strives to maintain backcompat, so the following method tries to
 divine the user intention as much as possible, using the following
 heuristics:

 * If both a commit SHA and branch name are provided, the commit SHA
   should be used, since it is more specific.

 * Each parameter will be checked.  If present and not equal to the
   empty string, it will be run through the _looks_like_sha method
   to decide whether this is a SHA or branch name.

 * The order checked is ref, version, sha, branch, revision.  ""ref"" is
   returned in the action links for file and folder metadata, and so
   takes precendence.  ""version"" is the most common parameter, used
   heavily in the OSF.  ""sha"" occurs occasionally, but despite the
   name can be either a commit SHA or branch name.  ""branch"" is used
   by fangorn and so far appears to always be a branch name.
   ""revision"" does not appear to be in regular use anymore, but has
   cropped up in development in old metadata entries.

 * If none of the query parameters are present or contain a valid
   commit SHA or branch name, WB will fall back to the default branch
   for the repo.

   instance with __new__ then updating its __dict__ with the saved
   parameters.  Objects that inherit from Exception behave a little
   differently; before the __dict__ is updated, the child class's
   __init__ is called with whatever positional args were passed in
   the call to Exception.__init__().  Since WaterButlerError calls
   Exception.__init__() with a single integer argument, every
   exception that inherits from it must survive instantiation with the
   same signature.

   This means that no child of WaterButlerError can have a signature
   with anything other than one positional argument.  It must not call
   any non-integer methods on the positional arg.  kwargs are not
   passed as part of the faux __init__ call, so a class must be able
   to be instantiated with defaults only.  It is not necessary that
   the exception be meaningful when called this way.  Its __dict__ is
   updated immediately afterward, so its state will be made consistent
   with its pre-pickling self.

   A new test file, test_exceptions.py, was added to enforce this.  It
   tries creating every available exception with a single integer arg.
   A new exception that cannot pass this will be considered buggy.

   Some of the existing exceptions had to be redesigned to accomodate
   this new restriction.  Their usages in the codebase have been
   updated, too.

   * UnsupportHTTPMethodError: formerly took two positional arguments,
     has been updated to take one positional and one kwarg. The kwarg
     for the list of supported methods was modified to support being
     passed a None.

   * FolderNamingConflict: relied on a `name` kwarg or its positional
     argument, `path`, being a string.  Updated to take a single
     `name` positional argument, which is passed to a format
     string. Resulting error message was simplified, and tests were
     updated to match.

   * NamingConflict: relied on a `name` kwarg or its positional
     argument, `path`, being a WaterButlerPath.  Updated to take a
     single `name` positional argument, which is passed to a format
     string. Resulting error message was simplified, and tests were
     updated to match.  Callers were updated to pass `path.name` as
     the arg in place of the full object.

   * GitHubUnsupportedRepoError: formerly took no positional
     arguments, updated to take a single, unused dummy argument.

 * Reformatted Dropbox-specific exceptions, updated tests, and added
   unpickling tests.

   hierarchy us that there were two inconsitently defined classes of
   errors.  One type of error is the developer-defined exception,
   built to reflect an expected and accounted-for error condition.
   The other is the unhandled-provider exception.  Since we don't have
   full control over external providers, we sometimes get unexpected
   responses from them.  When that happens, we need to throw an
   exception that contains the received status code and error message.

   Unhandled-provider exceptions are thrown from the
   waterbutler.core.provider.make_request method, which calls
   waterbutler.core.exceptions.exception_from_response to build the
   error.  These providers must all have the same signature, since
   they are being programattically built.

   Developer-defined errors may accept more specialized arguments,
   define specific message strings, and have default error
   codes. Their signatures do not have to follow a spec (this is
   ominous foreshadowing, see the next commit).

   The hierarchies of both types of errors were entangled, leading to
   confusion errors, and misuse.  The unhandled-provider errors now
   have their own parent class, UnhandledProviderError, which is not
   shared with developer-defined exceptions.  Developer-defined
   exceptions continue to inherit from ProviderError.

   Related changes:

   * exception_from_response's default error class is now
     UnhandledProviderError, rather than ProviderError.

   * make_request also now defaults to UnhandledProviderError

   * make_request calls in the figshare and googledrive providers were
     updated to throw unhandled-provider errors, instead of
     developer-defined errors.

   * docstrings were added and the exception definitions shuffled
     about to group similar exceptions together.

 * UnsupportedHTTPMethodError's parent changed from PluginError to
   WaterButlerError, since it is conceivably useful by the core server
   classes, not just the auth handlers.

   response.  Update WB to calculate a corresponding hash and compare.
   If they are different, corruption must have happened.  Throw an
   error so the user is notified.

   In addition, some providers return hash data in standard metadata
   responses.  WB should be returning this in our standard file
   metadata responses.

 * Per provider explanations:

   * box: Returns a sha1 of the file on upload and in metadata.  Hash
     available in file metadata in the `extra.hashes.sha1` key.

   * cloudfiles: Returns an md5 as the etag on file upload and in
     metadata.  Hash available in file metadata in the
     `extra.hashes.md5` key.

   * dataverse: Returns an md5 in file metadata, which WB must request
     after upload.  Hash available in file metadata in the
     `extra.hashes.md5` key.

   * dropbox: Returns a dropbox-specific hash[1], so WB does not
     assert on upload.  Hash is available in the
     `extra.hashes.dropbox` key.

   * figshare: Returns an md5 in file metadata, which WB must request
     after upload.  Hash available in file metadata in the
     `extra.hashes.md5` key.

   * github: Returns a git blob hash, which is the sha1 of the blob
     content with the string 'blob $blob_size\0' prefixed to it.  Hash
     available in file metadata in the `extra.hashes.git` key.

   * googledrive: Returns an md5 on upload and in metadata.  Hash
     available in file metadata in the `extra.hashes.md5` key.

   * owncloud: Does not provide any file hashes.

   * s3: Returns an md5 as the etag on file upload and in metadata.

   filename ends with `.txt` GitLab's response will be serialized as a
   Ruby hash rather than JSON.  This is avoidable by percent-encoding
   the period in the extension, but RFC 3986 recommends NOT encoding
   periods. In addition, if we manually construct the url with an
   encoded period, aiohttp decodes it again before sending.

   Rather than trying to mess with aiohttp internals (which would
   affect all providers), we will instead try to convert the Ruby
   serialization to json, then deconvert.  The metadata returned by
   this endpoint is limited to just a few fields, most of which have
   well-defined representations.  The current naive approach is
   adopted from a StackOverflow question.  We may need to make this
   more robust, since the `file_name` and `file_path` fields may
   contain special characters that may break the naive method.

   always ended with a trailing slash.  If it didn't, then create
   folder and move/copy operations would create spurious folders and
   error.  Both methods were creating their target urls naively,
   assuming that simple string concatenation of the base folder path
   and the target path would suffice.  They've been updated to use the
   WaterButlerPath object that is passed in, which correctly handles
   slash-less base folders.

   We also use the base folder setting to look up folder names in the
   OwncCloud metadata response.  That method was also counting on the
   base folder always ending with a slash.  To fix this, if the
   provider constructor receives a base folder without a trailing
   slash, it will add one.

   This commit adds tests to ensure that the trailing slash is always
   present after contruction and also adds a basic test for the
   create_folder method.

   the iscoroutinefunction() to be stricter in its testing.  Prior to
   this, it would return True for mock objects.  With this fix
   (applied in 3.5.3 and 3.6.0), it now returns False.

   This was causing test failures in some of the v0 test suites,
   because we were relying on the ability to detect when we should
   unrwap our MockCoroutines.  With 3.5.3 and above, the MockCoroutine
   was not being unwrapped, causing the await call to return a
   coroutine instead of the function results.

   To work around this MockCoroutine has been taught to to slip past
   iscoroutinefunction() by importing the variable that it uses to
   identify a coroutine function.  This is only applied on Python >=
   v3.5.3, as this variable was not present before then.

   This commit also fixes another error exposed by the upgrade to
   3.5.3, where an unneccesary event loop was being started to get the
   results of an upload coroutine.  This is a v0-only test issue.

   view on GoogleDrive but not MFR.  The core problem was that they
   had read-only permission for these files, and the Google Drive API
   returns a 403 when requesting the revision list for such files. WB
   was failing to handle this gracefully and was returning a 500.

   While investigating this, it was discovered that there are some
   other quirks in the provider.  Readonly Google Docs were primarily
   affected, since they require an extra call to the revisions API.

   There was also some inconsistency in how we handled revisions.
   This appears to have been a known problem for some time.  To avoid
   it an early attempt was made to signal these troublesome files by
   appending a sentinel value to the revision id.  However, WB was
   handling the sentinel value inconsistently, meaning it was
   sometimes respected and sometimes not.

   This commits attempts to clean this up and provide consistent
   behavior for all combinations of file type, editability, and
   revision format. The behaviors are:

    * If a download or metadata request is made without a revision
      parameter for a file of any type or editability, WB will
      download or provide metadata for the latest version.

    * If a download or metadata request is made and the revision ends
      with the sentinel value, WB will download or provide metadata
      for the latest version.  This is true for all files.

    * If a file is read-only (user has view or commenting permissions)
      and a revision is given that DOES NOT end with the sentinel
      value, WB will respond with a 404 Not Found. Read-only files do
      not have revisions.

    * If a file is editable and a revision is given that DOES NOT end
      with the sentinel value, WB will respond with a 404 if the
      requested revision does not exist on Google Drive.  Otherwise,
      it will return the content or metadata for the file at that
      revision.

   * A user copies a file from a directory in the repo over an
     existing file that has the same contents.

 In both cases, the tree is unmodified, and no new commit is
 needed. In the case of the update, we must issue an extra request to
 test if the new blob sha is the same as the old blob sha for the
 updated file.  In the case of the copy, we have the root tree sha
 from before the operation.  When we upload the new tree contents to
 GH, it returns the sha of the new root tree.  We can compare them,
 and if they are the same avoid creating a new commit.

This logging was happening in five different places in the code:

 * .server.api.v0.core.BaseProviderHandler._send_hook
 * .server.api.v0.core.BaseCrossProviderHandler._send_hook
 * .server.api.v1.provider.__init__.ProviderHandler._send_hook
 * .task.copy.copy
 * .task.move.move

This commit moves all logging code to one subroutine,
.core.utils.log_to_callback.  This subroutine takes a source LogPayload
and an optional destination LogPayload and constructs a common log
payload to be sent to the logging server.

The LogPayload class is a simple wrapper class to hold the logged
object's parent resource, serving provider, and a path or metadata
object to be serialized.  It serves to enforce the argument contract and
to format the log object in a common way.

`contents` API endpoint to retrieve metadata about the path, so that
it could determine whether a file or folder at that path already
exists and is of the correct type.  Unfortunately, the `contents`
endpoint also returns the file contents along with the metadata.
Because of this, GitHub will refuse to respond if the requested file
is bigger than 1Mb.  `validate_v1_path` has been updated to request a
recursive tree listing, which it can then search through for the given
path.

entity's id by traversing from a base path and searching for something
that matches its path.  But in gdrive, a folder and file can have the
same name, so a simple name match could return the wrong entity. Infer
the requested entity type from the given name and restrict query to that.

Fixing this bug also revealed a bug in gdrive's validate_v1_path.
When the path passed to `_resolve_path_to_ids` doesn't exists, the
method returns a final path part whose ""id"" is None.  It also sets a
bogus mime type.  Updated validate_v1_path to throw a 404 if the
explicit path returned from `_resolve_path_to_ids` doesn't have an id.

  semantics on PUT create requests, our provider were behaving in many
  different ways on duplicate requests.  Here are our expected
  semantics:

  1. `PUT /$provider/?kind=folder&name=i-am-a-folder`

    If a folder named `i-am-a-folder` doesn't already exist, create it and
    return 201 Created.  If it does exists, return 409 Conflict.

  2. `PUT /$provider/?kind=file&name=i-am-a-file`

    If a file named `i-am-a-file` doesn't already exist, create it and
    return 201 Created.  If it does exists, return 409 Conflict.

  3. `PUT /$provider/i-am-a-file?kind=file`

    If a file named `i-am-a-file` doesn't already exist, throw a 404 Not
    Found. If it does exists, update the file and return 200 OK.

  osfstorage and box were violating example 2, because the `name`
  parameter wasn't being translated into the ID needed to check for
  existence.  googledrive was failing because its metadata fails if
  called on a WaterButlerPath whose ID hasn't been established yet.

  **THIS MAY BREAK EXISTING CODE** Because I'm dumb, I forgot to update
  the API documentation here and in the OSF.  Example 1 was documented
  correctly, but occasionally allowed overwriting or additional creates
  in non-osfstorage providers.  After this commit, it no longer should.
  Example 2 was incorrectly documented, so anyone relying on `PUT
  /?kind=file&name=foo` to update a file should switch to using Example
  3.  If you were use on the `/links/upload` attribute of the
  JSON-API response, you won't need to do anything, as that gave the
  correct url.  Example 3 is unchanged.

stoarge provider roots (e.g. DELETE /resources/mst3k/provider/box/),
but handled them inconsistently.  Some providers would clear out the
root folder, some would 500, some would delete the actual storage root
folder on the provider, breaking the OSF addon.

This commit makes DELETEs against the storage root officially
supported.  When a DELETE is issued against the root, WB will delete
all files and folders underneath the root, but will not delete the
root folder itself.  Since this behavior is dangerous and differs
semantically from deletes againt other folders, we have decided to
require that the caller pass the query argument `confirm_delete=1`
with the call.  Otherwise, WB will respond with a 400 Bad Request.
`confirm_delete` is only required for deletes against the storage
root.

Fixes: [#OSF-5504]

Each provider had been assigned their own ticket, which was later
superseded by OSF-5504.  Those tickets are:

  * [#OSF-5505] - google drive
  * [#OSF-5774] - github
  * [#OSF-5782] - dropbox

in how we handle bucket names outside the US (N. Virginia) region.
Amazon permits bucket names that follow subdomain-naming conventions
(labels separated by periods).  WB had been accessing buckets using
the subdomain calling format, which would access a bucket named 'foo'
at `https://foo.s3.amazonaws.com/`.  However, wildcard nested
subdomain certificates are deprecated, and Pythons newer than 2.7.9
will throw a certificate checking error if you try to access them.
IOW a bucket named 'foo' will still work, but a bucket named 'foo.bar'
will try to connect to `https://**foo.bar**.s3.amazonaws.com/` and
will fail validation.

`boto`, the library WB uses to communicate with S3, supports another
calling format that avoids this issue, the `OrdinaryCallingFormat`.
Under OCF, a call to a bucket named `foo.bar` is directed to
`https://s3.amazonaws.com/foo.bar/`, and so the certificate will pass
validation.  The catch is that buckets in regions outside US
(N. Virginia) require the request to be sent to a region-specific URL.
The OSF doesn't currently track the bucket's region, so WB has to
look it up via the S3 API.  Once we have the region, we can update the
host, and all S3 actions should succeed.

the situation where the new entity has the same name as another entity
of the opposite type in that directory.  Some providers allow this,
others do not, and others (Dropbox) behave weirdly.  We want to
provide consistent semantics for all providers.  When the provider
allows simultaneous names, each request should succeed with a 201
Created.  When they do not, the first request, regardless of kind,
should succeed, and the second should fail with a 409 Conflict.

Logic:

Note: this only applies to the case where the entity in the path
is a folder.  If it's a file, the collision isn't possible.

First we check if the target path already exists within the directory.
If so, we throw a 409, because we don't want to overwrite what's
already there.  If the user wants to update a file, they should do a
PUT against the file's endpoint, not the parent folder's.

If the target path does not exist, we check to see if the provider
allows files and folders with the same name to coexist.  If so,
there's no problem. If not, we check for the existance of an entity
with the same name of the opposite type.  If it exists, we throw a
409, otherwise proceed as usual.

One bit of weirdness is that Dropbox's exists() method returns [] if a
folder with the same name exists.  In this case, [] means True, but
python treats it as a falsey value.  To avoid this, we need to
explicitly test if the retval from exists() is a bool.

path given in the url was valid.  Since some of our validations test
argument/path combinations, we should move these until after weve
validated the path.  However, path validation always costs us at least
one provider API call, and some providers have strict rate limits.  To
avoid this, split the argument validators into pre- and
post-validators. Pre-validators are run before path validation and let
us reject bad queyr parameters, invalid header formattings, etc. early.
Post-validators are run after path validation and can accurately test
path/argument combinations.

parameter to calculate the signature.  It adds the ttl to the
result of time.time() to calculate the expiry time, then includes that
value as part of the signature payload.  If the time ticks over by a
second between when the mock url and request urls are generated, the
signatures will be different.  The signature is sent in a query param,
so the request mocker will fail to match the requests.

To fix, freeze time for all of s3.  The signature is required for all
requests, so freeze all request-making test classes.  I originally
tried wrapping the entire module in a freeze, but that failed.
Presumably, because the tests are being run asynchronously.  So
instead I decorated each test class individually.

delete the folder, because folders on S3 are inferred from the pathnames
of the file objects.  To fully delete a directory, we must delete each
object within it.  Amazon provides a bulk delete operation to make this
more efficient.

To run the bulk delete, we must first get the keys of all the objects
within the directory, then POST a request with an XML body containing
the keys to the delete endpoint.  S3 limits their object list
responses and bulk delete requests to 1000 entries.  In the event that
more than 1000 entries need to be deleted, we issue multiple requests
in 1000-key batches.

being left behind.  This was because the tree entry for the source
directory was left in the modified master tree, where it still contained
references to the old blob/tree.  The solution was to remove all tree
entries from the master tree and to allow github to infer the new tree
structure from the path names of the remaing blobs.

v1 expects folder paths to always end with a slash and file paths to
never end with a slash.  However, it wasn't enforcing this and some
manually-constructed tests were 500ing as a result.  It was decided
that trying to address folders as file and vice-versa should
consistently produce 404s.  This is especially important for providers
