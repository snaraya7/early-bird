via a ViewIntent, by visiting a URL such as:
https://google.github.io/pienoon/launch/default/snowdown

(note: we shold probably create this landing page!)

This change depends on I82cba714, which fixes some assets module issues
and adds support for including additional Flatbuffers files in overlays
that are not present in the main folder.

You can also force Snowdown mode by including a file in the root assets
directory called ""default_overlay.txt"" containing the name of the overlay
to use (in this case, ""snowdown""). You can turn this on for Android
builds by uncommenting a line in Pie Noon's android_config.mk.

is made. This causes SDLSurface to attempt to start up another thread to
run native code. To prevent this a boolean tracking the exiting state
has been added.

Tested on Android.

instead rendering initially to a framebuffer object, then using
Cardboard to undistort and render that.

This should be a significant performance increase, as it can directly
modify what would be rendered as a texture, instead of having to read
off of the default framebuffer.  On Nexus 5, this resulted in a 20%
increase in framerate, and makes it have no noticeable difference
versus not using undistortion at all.

- Separated ‘Render’ pass and ‘Event’ pass so that the user can retrieve input information
  before a rendering happens. This is useful when the game state needs to be updated by imgui input
  in the same rendering cycle. (Older model does not allow that but needs to wait until next rendering
  cycle because UI rendering needs to come at the last stage.)

  To determine if it’s in ‘Event’ pass inside the lambda, the user can use ‘GetCurrentPass()’ API.
- Added GetCurrentPass() and misc API to imgui.
- Added HasFocus() API to retrieve gamepad focus state from an element.
- NOTE: Button state update based on GPGS sign in state is not implemented yet.
  Need to find a best practice to switch UI based on game state while keeping UI defined by data and has
  separate rendering logic.

pie, you will now give them a ""splat"" which will block one of their
buttons for a turn at random. (large pie = 2 splats).

This is implemented by adding the 4 splats (one per button) to the
multiscreen menu, and having them default to invisible. Whenever
the multiplayer director sends out the player status, it also tells
each player which buttons of theirs are obscured. The client hides
the buttons underneath the splats (and sets the buttons to be
inactive during that time).

Because the splats fade out on top of buttons, this necessitated
adding a small hack to our soon-to-be-thrown-away menu system,
a render_after_buttons flag to StaticImage to cause the splats to
be drawn after the buttons so the alpha renders properly.

Tested: Start a multiscreen game. Let a pie grow to medium or large
size, and throw it at an opponent. Observe the opponent's screen to
see one or two of their buttons obscured.

pindrop's AudioConfig struct. The compiler isn't failling because it
can't find the file, so the file is clearly there. This leads me to
believe that an older build generated the header file and left it there.
When the builder attempts to build the project, it searches the include
directories for audio_config_generated.h and finds the obsolete version
from before Pindrop was split off into its own project, and attempts to
use that. To fix this, I've deleted the gen directory at the begining of
each build to prevent stale generated files from persisting between
builds.

Tested this change locally on linux and it works (but it also works
without it locally)

impeller interface, for example, GetVelocity() or GetTargetValue().

The new interface entirely separates the Impeller1f (single float
Impellers) from ImpellerMatrix4f (4x4 float matrix Impellers).

This allows us to remove the nonsensical functions for matrix,
and to specify matrix specific Set() functions too.

We also have fewer templates, and a more traditional class
heirarchy, which is nice.

The vec2, vec3, and vec4 Impellers don't look like they're going
to be as fundamental as I originally thought, so in the interest
of simplicity, I've removed them for the moment.

Tested: Builds on Linux, Android, Mac. Unit tests succeed. Pie Noon

Instead of caching the values, we can do a complete initialization

Centralize management of indices to ImpelProcessorBase.

Simplify overshoot and smooth processors by eliminating base
class.

Convert smooth to use dual cubic spline.

Allow vectors of Impellers. An explicit copy constructor and
operator= ensures that the ImpelProcessor always has a pointer
to the unique Impeller for an index. Allows data to be
Defragmented.

Make Defragmenting a lazy operation. Can (optionally) be called
when necessary in each ImpelProcessor's AdvanceFrame function.

Tested: Pie Noon runs fine. Unit tests run fine. Added a couple of
unit tests for Defragment() and copy functionality.

ndk-build -j4 -C Z:\path_to\pie_noon\jni\src V=1 \
  NDK_OUT=Z:\path_to\pie_noon\libs APP_ABI=armeabi-v7a V=1

make is unable to find SDL source files.  If the makefile is modified
to use absolute paths to the source files the overall project will
fail to build...

ndk-build -j4 -C Z:\path_to\pie_noon V=1 \
  NDK_OUT=Z:\path_to\pie_noon\libs APP_ABI=armeabi-v7a V=1

To work around this issue, this change moves the library makefiles
under jni/libs so that they can be excluded from the build process.
Instead only the top level makefile jni/Android.mk is used to build
the native component with ndk-build.

Tested:
Verified the project builds successfully for Android on Windows, Linux

cause the menu items to spuriously change as you moved your
phone around.

There's no way to directly tell if an SDL joystick is a accelerometer
joystick or not, unfortunately. We do want to only consider
joysticks that have at least two buttons, however, for our game,
which the accelerometer joysticks do not have. So, our solution is to
ignore any joystick that does not have at least two buttons.

Also, refactored the Input class a little bit. Keep SDL_Joystick*
around instead of SDL_JoystickID, because it's more versatile
in the SDL API.

the lock screen to become active. The lock screen is in landscape
mode.

This causes onDestroy and onCreate to be called on out game,
since our game can only run in portrait mode. This happens even
though the device is sleeping.

This caused the appearance of the game to ""keep going even though
the device is in sleep"". In actuality, the game is being destroyed
and restarted.

The solution is to handle the orientation change ourselves,
instead of using the default destroy/create behavior. We were
doing this half way (we specified ""orientation"" in our
self-configuration list) but we also need to include ""screenSize"".

compile and link in libogg and libvorbis. Custom CMakeLists were added
for those projects as well as sdl_mixer (rather than use the one I
previously added sdl_mixer's own source tree).

Minor changes to the .gitignore file since we now need to track the
contents of sdl_mixer and MSVC solution and project files.

Executables are now all dropped in bin/ because it's better organized
that way and becuase this ensures that the SDL .dll files end up in the
right place along with the executable. Updated the various shell and
make scripts to look in the right place for executables.

Due to a compiler problem on windows, a number of places where we had
vectors of structures have been replaced by vectors of pointers to
structures. As a result, a bunch of places went from using . to ->, and
a bunch of functions now take pointers instead of references.

Removed references to windows headers that were pulled in to use `Sleep`.
Instead, we SDL_delay.

Suppressed some warnings in visual studio when compiling mathfu.

Changed a bunch of ints to size_t, uint8_t or uint16_t types as
appropriate because Visual Studio is really stingy about implicit
typecasts.

Tested on Linux and Windows.

which feels more appropriate. The final name is still tbd.

Centralized the computation in ""ImpelProcessors"". Each type
of ""Impeller"" has one (and only one) central processor.
All of the Impellers get updated in one function call. This
allows for the use of SIMD or (more easily) parallized
algorithms.

All of the ""ImpelProcessors"" are held in an ""ImpelEngine"".
To update the simulation, the user calls ImpelEngine::AdvanceFrame,
which updates all Impellers by the requested time step.
Most games will want to update everything at once. In the rare
situation that you need separate updates for some Impellers,
you can have multiple ImpelEngines.

Remove the old ""Magnets"" code, and update the tests to run on
the new ""Impellers"".

Tested: Ran together with old Magnets system before deleting.
Asserted that results are identical. Unittests run fine. All
tests on Linux.

input had gone down this frame, but not if the key was still being held
down. Controllers now track whether an input still down and if it went up
this frame.

The character statemachine transitions have also been expanded to
account for this, so transitions can now occur based on whether keys
have gone up or down this frame, or if they're being held down or if
they're not being held at all.

Finally, this has been experimentally hooked up to character blocking,

This is not strictly true for very sharp angles (some trees might obscure
some characters), but it is true for any reasonable camera angle in our
current design.

The pies too, aren't perfect, since they are sometimes in front of
characters, but they move so quickly it's hard to notice a problem. At some
point we may want to revisit this and sort characters and pies more
precisely. For the moment, I think the fixed ordering looks good though.

ambiguous meanings. Merging them together makes things easier
at run time too, and is conceptually simpler.

it will be good to have a play-test with newbies to see how it
works.

The gist of this change is to make block responsive. Block is now
effective immidiately, can be entered from idle, and can be
exitted by pressing the 'throw' key (up). When you exit block,
you go immediately to throw-1, which also feels right, though I
think it might be overpowered.

As it turns out, the only time you can't block is after you throw,
so throwing is a big weakness. This feels really good to me. It
adds some strategy to the game. You need to throw at someone who's
just thrown--that's fun. You don't want to be the first to throw,
therefore, but as soon as one pie *is* thrown, it will be mayhem.

Good mechanic, perhaps. Or maybe another doozy. We'll see!

The fix creates geo for each cardboard cutout in proportion to the
image for that cardboard. This lets the artist control the size
of cutouts directly via the size of the image.

Also, use meshes instead of materials directly. Hides the rendering
implementation a little more nicely.

caused the perspective matrix to be a bit wacky, which we
compensated for downstream with other wackiness.

To fix things, we convert to radians (pi/2 = 45 degree fov),
use right handed coordinate system (to keep z-axis going into
the scene--we may want to change this later), draw textures
right-side up (they were upside down to compensate for the
wacky 30 radian fov).

We avoid push_back when initializing textures. Saves some
reallocations, though the result is the same.

We recalculate the initial camera matrix.

We simplify the camera rotation. No need to move it to the
origin since rotation and translation are independent
operations in an affine transform.

For example, 178 degrees + 3 degrees = -179 degrees.
(Note: we use radians in the class.)

You can ignore modular arithmetic, but then you lose:
- comparisons for equality
- differences between angles (which should always be < 180 degrees)
- precision, since larger floating point numbers are less precise.

An Angle class is nice because it can abstract the process of
renormalizing to the range (-pi, pi].

This is something we may want to eventually bring to mathfu.
We'll want to generalize it so that you can specify at compile-time
what the angle coordinate system is, though.

Tested: Added angle_test.cpp. Passes on Linux.

We should consider allowing dependencies to be specified in fbs

Also, fix tests. Now that the state machine references the Timeline,
and not just an anim string, the interface has changed.
