On openSUSE libLLVMCore.so is missing for LLVM-5, so we can only
use the LLVM target there.

On travis the LLVM target is not present and we can/need to use the
LLVMCore target.

These checks in this particular order fix building on Debian with
apt.llvm.org packages, openSUSE and travis.

I could not find any documentation on when which targets are available
or why everything behaves like this. If anyone finds out something
