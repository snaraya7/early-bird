squished as the labels first took up an amount of room to the left of
the field proper. The better and desired approach here was to use the
.stacked class - rendering the labels atop the field.

However this approach would require every element built to add the
extraClass to the FormField instance in PHP in the getCMSFields method.
This is less than ideal, so it was decided to proceed with an override
for elements (and elements only) that will achieve the same effect.

Also addresses checkboxes and radio buttons where the label generally
sits on the other side of the input element, where .stacked does not.

When a loading error occurs the InlineLineEditForm cannot be rendered, this would cause the Summary component to be toggled erroneously.
It makes more sense for ElementalAreaController to inherit from CMSMain rather than LeftAndMain, as this means that permissions are checked in relation to the Page Level rather than for the entire CMS.

default to having no title, and no content (of any type). They now
are given some filler text for a title, at a different shade to
indicate the fact that it is not a 'real' title, and all elements
have a min-height... not by explictly setting this, but by always
drawing the content area summary paragraph (even if it's empty).

This also solves the case of when there is only one element in the
area, one could see the area 'sticking out' from behind the element.
Because the element is now larger (mostly padding and margins) this
no longer happens.
