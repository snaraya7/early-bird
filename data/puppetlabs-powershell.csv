load the PowerShell executable path for use. Once the module was refactored
to rely on the ruby-pwsh gem via the puppetlabs/pwshlib module, the code for
determining the path was updated to depend on a helper function. However,
the commands method is (apparently?) evaluated during catalogue compilation,
causing the Puppet run to explode unexpectedly if the dependent module is
not available.

This commit removes the commands idiom and relies on the feature confine which
should evaluate during a Puppet run and, when that feature is not found
(because puppetlabs/pwshlib is not installed) it will report that the provider

ruby-pwsh ruby code (found in the dependency module,
puppetlabs-pwshlib) in a begin-rescue block and adds
a loud error message that points at the solution.

This will cause the loading of the providers to still
fail during autoloading, but to do so usefully.

We chose not to use the feature/confine pattern
because it is not supported by the resource_api, the
primary interface through which we expect community
members to write types and providers in the future.

We chose not to use a utility loader method, which
would have prevented breaking during autoloading,
because of the friction and additional complexity
cost incurred for every module needing to adopt
this pattern.

While this rescued-requires pattern will still
cause an error during autoloading, this should
only be possible in cases where the module is
being installed from github and the dependency
chain is not installed.

the inbound pipe.  Normally this works fine.  However the Travis CI testing
was intermittently failing where the pipe was only reading half the pipe,
which then caused the first test to fail, and then any subsequent tests failed
because it was reading left-over data from the previous failed read.

The documentation of the IO.sysread method [1] says the argument is maxlen
which implies that this the maximum number of bytes it would return.  Note that
other methods in IO use the language ""Reads at most maxlen bytes from ios""
whereas sysread uses the langauge ""Reads maxlen bytes from ios""

This commit changes the pipe reader to read in chunks of bytes until all of
the expected bytes are read.  Note that this is a blocking call so if you
try to read beyond the bytes in the pipe it blocks the thread.  The value
of 8K chunk was an arbitrary number which is big enough to get most powershell
repsonse in a single IO read.  The integration tests were failing to read in
a 96K chunk (only ~36K were read)

execute that. This is considered a legacy method.  The more modern method, which
is used in the Windows PowerShell provider, is to use the PowerShell Manager.

This commit updates the PowerShell Manager for using PowerShell Core on both
Windows and non-Windows platforms:

* The pwsh provider was modified to use the PowerShell manager if it is supported
  otherwise revert to the legacy temporary path

* The pwsh provider changed the scope of the pwsh_args and get_pwsh_command to
  public so that they can be used the spec tests.  As they're readonly properties
  it is safe to surface these methods

* Modified the PowerShell manager to use Unix Domain Sockets when on non-Windows
  platforms.  This is due to the .Net implmentation of the NamedPipesClient class
  using Domain Sockets on non-Windows platforms as opposed to Named Pipes. [1] [2] [3]
  The manager creates the domain sockets in the user's tmp directrory

  This also means the errors returned on bad/failed pipes is different e.g. EOFError
  and EConnReset.  Also many of the integration tests assume a real named pipe, so
  these tests are guarded to only run on Windows. Note that it was not possible to
  replicate the ""delete named pipe"" using Unix Domain sockets due to how sockets are
  different to named pipes.

* Modified many of the tests to either be platform independent by either removing the
  platform specific things e.g. remove \r\n references or specific exit codes.  Or the
  tests are modified to use specific items on specific platforms e.g. cmd.exe on Windows
  and /bin/sh on non-Windows.

* Removed the use of aliases (e.g. ps and ls) as they were causing test failures as they
  behave differently on different platforms.  Instead prefer commands like Get-Verb or
  $PSVersionTable which are consistent.

* Moved the 'when specifying a working directory' test from unit to integration as
  it actually calls the operating system for information and was causing failures when
  pwsh was not installed

* Modified the PowerShell Manager integration tests to be a shared example group and
  can then simply use 'it_behaves_like' calls to test when appropriate.  This is
  important on non-Windows when pwsh isn't installed.

* Modified the unit tests for the pwsh provider to use a mocked PowerShell Manager when
  invoked.

to use.

This commit removes the :pwsh command because command resolution
can not use a custom path when searching. This is normally used to see
if a provider is applicable.  It is then replaced by a method called
get_pwsh_command which uses a copy of the Puppet `which` command which
can use custom search paths when locating binaries.

Note we can not extend or update the Puppet version of this code as
the which method is private. In this case we copy the code verbatim
and then modify it.

This commit also will now fail a catalog apply if pwsh can not be
located. Previously it would error that no suitable provider could
be found.

This commit also updates the READMe and metadata.json to reflect the
operating systems that the pwsh provider will run on.

enhanced commonication method is to have .NET 3.5 installed.

The warning message a user received however implied that if you
installed any version higher than 3.5, such as .NET 4.0, that the
message should go away, and receiving it was a bug in the check logic,
which was testing specifically for .NET 3.5 and not >= 3.5.

Unfortunately, our testing confirmed that installing .NET 4.0 on a
machine is not enough to enable the enhanced features in the module.
Having .NET 4 installed does not automatically enable PowerShell 2 to
load the newer asseblies or use the more advanced features in that
version of the CLR. Specific steps must be taken to enable that to
happen, such as editing registry keys, or writing a
powershell.exe.config to the disk. The results of doing this are also
unpredictable.

The change in this commit updates the upgrade message returned to the
user to make it clearer that when using PowerShell 2, the only way to
enable the enhanced features is to install .NET 3.5, not 3.5+.

pwsh. This is because the name of the binary has changed in the
latest PowerShell betas. This commit also removes the manual checking
of specific paths like /usr/local/bin for the pwsh executable.
Instead for non Windows platforms we simply call pwsh and let the
platform do the path resolution based on current PATH settings. One
reason to switch to this behavior is the Mac OS X preferences
for ordering /usr/local/bin in path before /usr/bin, as some other
platforms do. The PATH checking in Windows was for specific use case
and we decided that absent that use case in other platforms, it should
be removed so that users get the behavior they expect based on their
platform, and not on internal Puppet logic.

   inspected for Output in the face of an error.

   This is problematic as completely valid information may have been
   written to stdout / stderr via the Write-Output / Write-Debug /
   Write-Error cmdlets (or other mechanisms).  This output can be
   helpful for end users to determine where executing PowerShell code
   may have failed.

   Add tests demonstrating such a trivial case, where the timeout for
   the script is set to 1.5 seconds, but the script has a `sleep 10`
   preventing it from completing successfully.

   Previously, none of the output would be collected in this error
   situation - but now the result object has more information
   populated.

   This should be very helpful for debugging.

 - Though not strictly necessary, ask the PowerShell instance to
   Stop execution by calling its Stop method, when the timeout has
   exceeded. Rather than throwing an exception and implicitly calling

- Modified Acceptance tests to flip which string to use based on the host

- Added Non-Windows (POSIX) test fixtures for use in acceptance tests as the
  Windows fixtures are not valid in POSIX platforms e.g. Get-Service is not

   module crashing when anything is written to the stderr stream via
   native executables or through [System::Console]::Error.

   The first assumption in the manager is that the XML includes a
   non-nil value passed back in the `stderr` element. It's completely
   valid to have no value present.

   The second assumption was that the captured stderr is a bare string.
   It will never be a bare string and should always be a single element
   string array at the very least.

   Additionally, code had incorrectly changed in fa3d618a2f breaking
   the contract of returning a stderr array from the manager to the
   calling provider. There were unfortunately no tests that caught
   this breakage, so one has been added.

   An additional test was added to produce multiline stderr output.

 - Note that v1 of the PowerShell module collects output in a
   different fashion and therefore the provider test handles this.

   stdout and stderr, rewrite the read_stdout method so that it uses
   individual threads to drain pipes, and synchronizes with a Mutex.

   Upon receiving a signal from PowerShell on the output ready event,
   ask the two threads to exit by unlocking the Ruby Mutex. That
   allows each thread to have .value called against it (which blocks
   until the thread terminates cleanly).

   Any exceptions from the threads still propagate as they did in the
   past when .value is called.

 - Necessarily refactor the is_readable? method so that each stream
   can check individually in it's own thread while draining, rather
   than making that part of the main event waiting loop. This
   continued stat'ing of the stream is a bit more expensive, but allows
   for more opportunity to propagate an EPIPE.

   Slightly rework the liveness check introduced in f7c08efc15 so that
   the main wait loop checks for process liveness and thread liveness.
   With no running child process there will never be a signal sent
   that will end the infinite loop.

   With the child process terminated, Ruby may still have valid file
   desriptors (which map to valid open Windows handles), that may
   never be considered readable by IO.select. This usually prevents
   any reads from occurring that might normally raise an EOFError.

   Also monitor the thread states to see if they're alive? and exit
   the wait loop when they error, assuming the call to .value will
   raise an exception after exiting the wait loop.

 - This has a nice side effect of guaranteeing that a pipe drain
   always returns an array of strings with nils removed, that can
   easily be concatenated to form a single string value for the
   first return value (output) from exec_read_result, and can be left
   untouched for the second return value (errors) to remain consistent
   with prior expectations

   render the module unable to process any more PS commands - and
   anything else in the Puppet run using the module would fail.

   A simple way to reproduce this is by explicitly calling:
   [Diagnostics.Process]::GetCurrentProcess().Kill()

   Or through a manifest such as:

   exec { 'KillPS':
     command  => '([System.Diagnostics.Process]::GetCurrentProcess()).Kill()',
     provider  => powershell,
     logoutput => true,
   }

   This could also happen if a pipe breaks with EPIPE, or if any of
   the IO streams are closed to a bad file descriptor (EBADF) or a
   more generic IOError.

 - Error handling for IO reads / writes is unified under the
   exec_read_result method. All EPIPE errors, IOError 'closed stream'
   and EBADF (bad file descriptor) errors are considered non-terminal,
   and simply inform the PowerShellManager that the current instance is
   unusable and the next time PowerShellManager.instance is called that
   a new PowerShell process should be created. It also ensures that the
   exit code from the execution is a -1, with the stderr containing the
   exception text and backtrace, which propagate through the provider
   and show up as additional info when --debug is set.

 - PowerShellManager.instance does this by explicitly calling an alive?
   helper which makes sure the process is running and all the streams
   are open and stat'able (stat was the only Ruby method that would
   generate an error when the underlying file descriptor or handle was
   bad).  When they are not, a new PowerShell process is created and
   this effectively self-heals between command execution.

 - alive? is also used when reading the PowerShell stdout / stderr and
   waiting for PowerShell to have signaled that the output is ready.
   If this check is not performed, the PS process can die (as is the
   case with the new tests), prior to signaling the event that Ruby
   is waiting on, which deadlocks Puppet.

 - Add a number of nefarious tests that tear down the underlying
   PowerShell process unexpectedly or that close the stdin, stdout or
   stderr streams in unexpected ways. Depending on Ruby version and
   the sequence of events these situations have slightly different
   failure modes which are captured in the tests.

   display more meaningful errors.  However, one type of error was not
   handled correctly.  If PowerShell generated an
   `IncompleteParseException` error, the message displayed to the user
   would suggest it was present at `throw $_.Exception.InnerException`
   in a line and offset that probably didn't exist.

   This is because unlike the `ParseException` type which gives useful
   information, an `IncompleteParseException` can not determine where
   in the script the error occurred.

   This commit changes catches the `IncompleteParseException` error
   and rethrows it as a simple text error.  This suppresses the
   `line:xxx char:xx` text from being shown to the user, while still
   displaying the root cause of the error.

   This commit refactors the tests slightly so that different error
   types are exercised; Runtime, ParseException and
   IncompleteParseException.

   NamedPipe listener directly inside the PowerShell code.  This can
   be written to from Ruby by calling File.Open with a Windows style
   .\\.\pipe\ path to the pipe.  This File is a Ruby IO instance that
   behaves just like the existing streams returned by popen3.

   Send commands through this mechanism for several reasons:

   - Guarantee the protocol between Ruby client and PowerShell host,
     so that any normal PowerShell stdin processing problems are
     averted.  WMF 5.1 (Windows 10 anniversary update / Windows Server
     2016) accidentally made some breaking changes to the stdin
     parsing which causes existing code to completely fail.  This new
     implementation works around that problem completely.

   - Strictly control the encoding so that passing UTF-8 values is
     not a problem.  By using binary data in the pipe, and not
     converting to a string until the data has been fully read, this
     ensures there are no problems buffering the pipe data / treating
     it as a string.

     Re-enable previously failing UTF-8 tests as they now pass.

   - All values passed to PowerShell from Ruby are length prefixed
     in number of bytes (of the current encoding, UTF-8) and lengths
     are passed as 32-bit Little Endian.

 - The PowerShell code now supports an encoding being passed in, in
   addition to the name of the named pipe that is being used. The
   encoding defaults to UTF-8 and the named pipe name must be passed
   in via Ruby.

   Some minor changes have been made to accomodate the new workflow

 - The manager, upon creation, must know whether it is operating in
   debug mode, so that it can pass that parameter through to the
   PowerShell bootstrap process, so that option has been added to
   its initializer.

 - While prior commits have redirected output written over
   [Console]::Out / [Console]::Error to internal StringWriter
   instances in the custom PowerShell host, the possibility still
   exists that a native binary may access the underlying stdout /
   stderr streams, subverting the .NET driven redirection.

   While that remains unlikely, ensure that those streams continue to
   be drained, so that a deadlock never occurs. This output is
   captured and returned so that the provider may emit it if a user
   asks for it (via --debug or logoutput parameter).

 - If the number of bytes written to the pipe are less than expected
   throw an error indicating a broken pipe.

   The EPIPE thrown will be caught in exec_read_result like the
   existing pipe breakages.

   Some tests have been written to demonstrate this behavior.

   execute an external script, and that script performed an ""exit 1"",
   that exit code would propagate.  This technique could be used within
   an unless or onlyif to ensure idempotent behavior like:

   unless => '& exit-one.ps1'

   This would allow users to create fully reusable PowerShell scripts
   that could be invoked outside of the Puppet environment during
   development and testing.

 - Since code is invoked differently in the v2 module, that behavior
   changed, and any exit codes set externally in a PS script invoked by
   the call operator are not propagating. The custom PowerShell host
   SetShouldExit method is not being triggered in this situation.

   This commit restores the old behavior by performing an
   exit $LASTEXITCODE after executing the user code.

   NOTE: this has the side effect of returning an exit code that may be
   unexpected, based on the last external command invoked by PowerShell.

   Users will be expected to understand this when developing longer more
   complex scripts.

   PowerShellManager attempts to be used, is only shown once, and only
   in a Windows environment. Previously, the message could be shown when

   agents have received the module during a pluginsync -- even though
   the Exec provider is unsuitable, and the code would never actually be
   run in such an environment.

 - Slightly restructure how the upgrade message is emitted, to make it
   more friendly to testing.  Tests will build a catalog and evaluate
   a manifest.  The helpers are heavily based on PuppetSpec::Compiler
   found in spec/lib/puppet_spec/compiler.rb in the Puppet codebase.

could lead some users to believe that the template() function is required.

This commit fixes that by converting the examples shown to using the

correctly by using 'Write-Error'. This worked incidently, but was not
technically correct. 'Write-Error' is a non-terminating error which
does not equate to a non-zero exit code. However, if it is the only
command sent to the PowerShell console, the PowerWhell host reports it
as a non-zero exit code. If something is added after 'Write-Error',
then a zero exit code is returned.

This can be seen in the following example:

PS C:\vagrant> powershell -command ""write-error foo""

includes some significant speed and system utilization improvements.
In the prior version every call to exec started a brand new PowerShell
process for each of the exec modes: command, onlyif and unless. This
was costly in both time and system resources as PowerShell takes
significant time to intialize and frequent process creations spike CPU
on the target system.

In this version, a single PowerShell process is created that lives not
only for all the modes of exec, but also for the entirety of the
Puppet run. We still have a one time cost of time and system
utilization for process creation for the entire run, but gain the
ability to run consecutive commands.

A second improvement to this version is that we directly pass commands
to PowerShell through shell redirection, and not through reading a
file in like the last version. This avoids any of the parsing errors
(MODULES-2634) we have seen. This also improves syntax checking, as we
now validate the passed in commands using PowerShell itself before the
command is run, allowing us to catch errors sooner and report them.

were originally testing internal Puppet code that was changed with this commit:
https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/commit/026b2f7ea996bb3ab5acbc0214919f3d5bc0754f.

The decision to test that far in may have been an easier decision point at the time
considering how much more difficult it has been getting rspec/mocha to evaluate
properly against a call to a super method within the confines of Puppet types and
providers. It has involved a combination of stubbing any calls to
`Puppet::Provider::Exec.any_instance`, expecting against calls to
`Puppet::Type::Exec::ProviderPowerShell.any_instance`, and aliasing the `run` method
in the spec to `run_spec_override` to allow calling the overridden method first and
only evaluating the call to the super method.

As an added bonus, all but 3 specs will run on non-Windows platforms.

I would have liked to create a tempfile and execute powershell with the
-File <path> option. However, powershell requires that puppet close the
file handle (or resort to native Win32 APIs to open the file with full
sharing). The former would expose puppet to TOCTOU race conditions. The
latter is hard, since ruby is the one creating the tempfile.

This commit executes powershell with redirected stdin. This solves the
original issues with passing the script on the commandline. And since
puppet never closes the tempfile handle until after powershell exits, the
file can't be modified after puppet writes the tempfile, and before
powershell writes it.

Note current versions of Windows use per-user temp directories with strong
permissions to minimize the likelihood of TOCTOU attacks on tempfiles, but
I'd rather not make (poor) assumptions, especially on Windows 2003.

suitable if powershell is installed and the binary is in your PATH when
puppet is running. The provider also does not take into account file
system redirection, so when running 64-bit OS's, the provider will invoke
the 32-bit version of powershell, since ruby is a 32-bit process.

When specifying the command to run (or the unless or onlyif exec
parameters, you will need to escape any powershell variables, e.g. `$_`,
or enclose them in single quotes so that puppet does not interpolate them.
