If for some reasons, start_test() has been delayed, agent's pipe collects unnecessary data.
And when start_test() occures, MonitoringCollector.poll prints huge blocks, thanks to debug print ""Data after filtering ..""

Fix: there is nothing to be done with agent - it doesn't know test status, when it was started etc.
So the only option is to compare timestamps from agent's data with time when start_test() has been occured and therefore
1) reduce debug output
2) send to datastorage only needed data
